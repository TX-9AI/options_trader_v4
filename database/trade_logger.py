database/trade_logger.py  v4.4
v4.4  2026-08-24  r103: orb_entry_since() — did an ORB trade actually open at or
      after a confirming bar? The adjudicator for fired-vs-missed, so a MISSED
      row is never written for a setup a prior process took and recorded.
v4.3  2026-08-24  CONDOR STOP SUPPRESSION: stop_suppressed_ts /
      stop_suppressed_by columns (schema + migration). Written by exit_engine
      v4.4 while a complementary condor leg is open, cleared on re-arm.
      While stop_suppressed_ts is set, condor_stop cannot be the exit —
      forensics should treat any contrary row as a defect. stop_premium is
      untouched and remains the immutable entry-time floor.

v4.2  2026-08-24  CONDOR REMODEL: condor_trigger_source column (schema +
      migration) — which of the four independent triggers produced the
      credit spread. BACKFILLED BUMP: this change shipped in the r89b
      archive without a version bump (base_strategy v4.2's changelog even
      pointed at a literal "trade_logger v(+1)"); recorded here so the
      header stops lying about the schema.

v4.1  2026-08-25  r65 EXORCISM: every mention of the retired classification
      system removed - identifiers, comments, docstrings, schema. The word
      does not appear in this tree. Full accounting: REMOVAL_LOG (delivery).

Trade schema, entry/exit logging, migrations.

v4.0  2026-08-19  Ported from options_trader_v3 at the OTV4 split.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
Dated release framing and trivia are stripped; what remains is the
reasoning behind the thresholds, the design guarantees, and the
defects that recur when forgotten. WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires
this block be read before the file is edited.

database/trade_logger.py — Options trade logging (SQLite). v3.15
SWALLOW T1: this file's silent handler(s) now announce
        themselves once. Behaviour unchanged in every case; only the silence
        was the defect.
TCS.4: log_entry FILTERS TO REAL COLUMNS AND WARNS.
        It INSERTed every key in the record, so a key with no column raised
        OperationalError and CRASH-LOOPED a live box (NFLX, 2026-08-17).
        A record key that is not a column is a BUG IN THE CALLER, but it must
        not be able to take a trading box down. Unknown keys are dropped.
        WARNED ONCE PER KEY NAME, because silently dropping a field that was
        SUPPOSED to persist is Pattern 2 - the class that produced this bug.
        Census run at the same time: `is_trend_credit` was the ONLY offender;
        this filter is a guardrail against the next one, not a fix for a
        population. PRAGMA is cached, not run per insert. FAILS OPEN if the
        schema cannot be read.
the two v3.12 setters now LOG INSIDE their except bodies.
        The 2026-08-05 swallow census flagged both as new TIER-1 silent
        handlers (87 -> 89) the morning after W.2a's lesson was written down:
        the census reads the HANDLER BODY, so a bare `return False` is silent
        no matter what the caller does. No behaviour change — the callers still
        warn once per reason and nothing gates on the result.
CONTRACT TELEMETRY (entry_delta/gamma/theta/iv,
        entry+exit bid/ask, exit_iv, chain_iv_rank) via set_entry_contract() /
        set_exit_contract(). TEN columns, not twelve: `entry_mark` and
        `chain_spot_at_entry` were dropped from the first cut because
        `entry_premium` and `underlying_entry` ALREADY HOLD THOSE FACTS. Two
        names for one value is how a report ends up quietly reading the stale
        one. Auto-migrates.
        Observability only — nothing gates on these.
        THE GAP IT CLOSES: every other instrument in this repo measures the
        labels) while the P&L is PREMIUM. Without the contract's own state,
        "wrong on direction", "right but theta ate it" and "IV crushed after
        the open" collapse into one number — and on 0DTE that is the whole game.
        NOTHING NEW IS FETCHED: OptionContract already carries bid/ask/mark/
        delta/gamma/theta/vega/iv and OptionsChain carries spot_price/iv_rank.
        They were read for strike selection and discarded.
        NULLS ARE LOAD-BEARING: rows from before this shipped must stay
        distinguishable from a capture that ran, so there are no defaults.
        See docs/MECHANICS.md "Contract telemetry" for what is collected and
        which reports read it.
EXIT LATENCY (N.5): exit_submit_ts / exit_fill_ts /
        exit_latency_ms / exit_ladder_steps / exit_escalated /
        exit_mark_at_trigger, plus set_exit_latency() (returns a bool, same
        reason as v3.10). Auto-migrated; NULL on every pre-existing row and on
        any close that was never confirmed.
        WHY IT MOVED FORWARD FROM AUG 24 TO THE AUG 10 BAKE: the dataset only
        accrues in sessions recorded AFTER it deploys, and TC.2's stop-trigger
        decision (-40% vs 35% vs 25%) is explicitly "calibrate against measured
        ladder fill-latency". At Aug 24 that is ~5 paper sessions before live
        capital; at Aug 10 it is ~15. Identical argument to v3.10's.
        `exit_mark_at_trigger` IS THE MEASUREMENT and is an addition to N.5's
        four named fields: latency in milliseconds is not a cost until it is
        priced, and the cost is (mark when the exit fired) - (price it actually
        filled at). In PAPER the two are equal by construction — that equality
        is the plumbing proof, not a result.
        TELEMETRY ONLY — nothing reads these columns in the trading path.
ENTRY SNAPSHOT: `entry_snapshot` (TEXT, JSON written by
        analysis/entry_snapshot.py) + set_entry_snapshot(), which RETURNS a
        boolean instead of discarding it. Auto-migrated; NULL on every
        pre-existing row and on any row whose capture failed.
        WHY: the TC.2 exit bake-off compares BoS / trail / 5m-FVG on IDENTICAL
        entries, and two of those three need the zone inventory the live engine
        held at entry. BoS does not — it re-derives from entry price and the
        post-entry tape — so only the FVG frame, its anchor, and the per-frame
        bar depth are stored. The 5m frame is CONTINUOUS across sessions while
        the banked tape is session-scoped RTH, so an offline reconstruction is
        a different object, not a cheaper one (same divergence class as defect
        S). Like v3.9 it pays off only in sessions recorded after it deploys,
        so its value decreases every session until the 2026-08-21 freeze.
        WHY IT RETURNS A BOOLEAN: update_fields() discards success, and
        AlertManager._send discarding an existing boolean is precisely what
        turned the blind-alert failure into a five-step hunt (item AU). A
        capture that silently no-ops would leave a column of NULLs that looks
        identical to "no trades taken".
        TELEMETRY ONLY — nothing reads this column in the trading path.
MFE/MAE TIMESTAMPS: max_premium_seen_at /
        min_premium_seen_at (TEXT, UTC ISO via ts_for_db — the SAME base as
        entry_time, deliberately, because comparing a UTC field against an
        ET-offset one has already inverted one verdict here). Auto-migrated,
        NULL on every pre-existing row.
        WHY, and why it could not wait: v3.8 stored the excursion EXTREMES as
        values with no time attached. That is enough to measure HOW MUCH a
        winner gave back and useless for asking WHETHER IT COULD HAVE BEEN
        EXTENDED — a trade that peaked at minute 2 and bled for twenty minutes
        and one that ran to the exit and reversed on the last tick produce the
        identical (MFE, realized) pair, and they call for opposite fixes: the
        first says the leash is too loose, the second says the move simply
        turned. No quantity of additional sessions resolves that; only the
        timestamp does. It pays off ONLY in sessions recorded after it
        deploys, so its value is strictly decreasing until the 2026-08-21
        freeze.
        TELEMETRY ONLY — no trade mechanics touched. The timestamp advances
        only when the extreme itself advances (CASE on the pre-update row),
        so it marks WHEN the peak/trough was set, not when it was last
        re-confirmed. SQLite evaluates every SET right-hand side against the
        ORIGINAL row regardless of clause order, so the CASE reads the old
        extreme even though it is written alongside the new one — proven by
        test_mfe_timestamp_tracks_only_new_highs rather than asserted.
        Consumers MUST treat NULL as "not recorded" and never as zero or as
        entry time: every row banked before this deploy has it.
F5 FIX (exit-reason integrity): new trail_stop column
        (schema + migration) + update_trail_stop(). The trail is now persisted
        separately; stop_premium is the immutable entry-time -25% floor.
        update_stop() removed — its only caller (position_manager) overwrote
        stop_premium with the trail, so every trail-armed exit was labeled
        'hard_stop_25pct'/'stop_hit'. Restart survivability preserved: the
        exit engine seeds its in-memory trail from trail_stop on recovery.
v3.0 — original release
add orb_range_high, orb_range_low, current_premium
        columns to schema for ORB exit logic and live P&L display
condor-leg support: spread columns (short/long strike,
        credit, width, is_condor_leg, condor_leg_num, is_broken_wing,
        short/long symbol) + get_open_trades() for concurrent condor legs.
add generic update_fields() (used by the broken-wing roll
        to flag rolled/tested legs is_broken_wing).
DEFINITIVE realized-P&L primitive: realized_pnl_today()
        (single source of truth for the daily-loss circuit breaker, status and
        query) with ET-correct session bucketing; today_summary() routed through
        it so displays and the halt can never disagree.
expiry-aware orphan handling: get_open_trades_live() (open
        rows not yet expired — 0DTE and weeklies alike, plus unknown-expiry rows
        kept for safety) and close_expired_open_trades() (auto-close ONLY rows
        whose expiry date has passed — a weekly with time left is left alone).
        Keyed on the stored expiry (YYYY-MM-DD), never on entry date, so a
        multi-day weekly is never mistaken for a same-day ghost.
broker reconciliation support: is_short_position column
        (schema + migration) so an adopted short survives a re-restart; and
        close_phantom() to close a DB row the broker no longer shows (broker is
        the source of truth for existence on live).
MFE/MAE TELEMETRY: max_premium_seen / min_premium_seen
        columns (auto-migrated), updated in the same per-tick write as
        current_premium. The evidence base for exit-threshold tuning — pairs
        with exit_engine v3.8's runner refinements so 40% floor / 5m FVGs /
        clamp / sweep runner mode can be judged on excursion data, not vibes.
MODE ISOLATION (audit defect Q). Every decision/session
        read is scoped to the current mode's rows via COALESCE(paper_trade,1):
        get_open_trade(s), close_expired_open_trades, get_session_losses,
        get_consecutive_losses, and _closed_today_rows — the DAILY_LOSS_LIMIT
        source of truth. A live bot can no longer adopt open paper positions or
        gate the real-money breaker on paper P&L (and paper stays clean of live
        rows symmetrically). Row WRITES are untouched — trade_id-keyed updates
        need no mode. Companion: configure.sh v2.0 archives trades.db on every
        mode switch so histories never mix in one file to begin with.
close_phantom() accepts recovered exit_price/pnl_usd so a
        manually-closed-at-broker phantom books its REAL fill from order history
        (broker_reconcile.match_closing_fills) instead of a flagged $0.00.
repo-wide v3.0 bump: Yahoo-Finance purge & data stream
        mapping optimization (all market data now flows from the single
        shared TastyTrade candle feed — see data/candle_feed.py). No logic
        change in this file.

# v3.11 (2026-08-04, N.5) — trades table also captures the exit ladder's latency: exit_submit_ts, exit_fill_ts, exit_latency_ms, exit_ladder_steps, exit_escalated and exit_mark_at_trigger. Written by exit_engine.place_exit_order() — the ONE seam both paper and live close through — via set_exit_latency(). This is the dataset TC.2's stop-trigger decision reads. Auto-migrates. Observability only.
# v3.10 (2026-08-04) — trades table also captures entry_snapshot: the FVG zones, the frame the trail would anchor to, the live StructureMap levels and the per-timeframe bar depth, all as held at the moment of the fill. Written by analysis/entry_snapshot.py via set_entry_snapshot(); the TC.2 exit bake-off is not computable without it. Auto-migrates. Observability only.
# v-obs2 (2026-07-24) — trades table also captures swept_level_name + level_strength (what KIND of liquidity level a sweep fired against — named PDH/PDL/session vs equal-H/L). Sweep postmortems: does level conviction predict outcome? Auto-migrates.
