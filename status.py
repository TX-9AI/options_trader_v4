status.py  v4.4
v4.4  2026-09-01  r211 (chunk C) — THE MIDDLE OF THE BOARD. Operator,
      2026-09-01: open positions "just list the number (nothing else)"; the
      duplicate-plan warning "what do I need this for — get rid of that";
      ORB "on expired, just say that without all the other qualifiers"; and
      "add a line for Character... put 'inactive' until it is" activated.
      ⚠️ THE COUNT REPLACES THE CARDS, AND THE DETAIL IS NOT LOST. Menu 15
      runs status.py and query.py in the SAME fan-out, and query.py still
      renders every position with its own card and the summed at-risk line
      (r199). What goes is the DUPLICATE of that figure, not the figure.
      🔴 THE CHARACTER LINE WAS ALREADY HERE AND HAS NEVER PRINTED. r75 gated
      it on `current()` returning a state; r85 then set BANDS_SET=False,
      because the old bands were calibrated against a per-bar volatility
      RATIO that is silent about direction — a trend scored 1.00 and
      ALTERNATING CHOP scored 1.00 too. So the engine emits nothing and the
      line was invisible on every box. ABSENT AND INACTIVE ARE DIFFERENT
      FACTS, and an unreadable engine is a THIRD one: it now prints
      inactive / unavailable / the state, and sits below the pin line.
      🔴 AND THE EXPIRED LABEL WAS STALE IN TWO PLACES. Both the live branch
      and `ORB_STATE_LABELS` read "past 11:00 ET cutoff"; r193 moved
      ORB_NO_ENTRY_AFTER_ET to 11:30 on 2026-08-30 and neither was updated.
      Two spellings of one constant is how the first rots unnoticed (§35) —
      and a line nobody reads is a line nobody notices going stale, which is
      the argument for deleting it rather than correcting it.
      ⚠️ THE PLAN COLLAPSE STAYS. r199 printed the collapsed COUNT so the
      ledger duplication remained visible and RPT.5 records the write side
      was never examined; chunk D repairs the writer, after which the
      collapse has nothing to do. Removing the collapse WITH the warning
      would render two identical plans as two rows — the defect inverted.
v4.3  2026-08-31  r199 — EVERY OPEN POSITION, NOT JUST THE NEWEST. The
      query asked for LIMIT 1 and the panel rendered it as the whole book,
      so a box holding a butterfly AND a directional trade under-reported
      both the positions and the capital at risk. Latent since r161 made
      the butterfly additive; r197 makes it the norm. Plan rows are also
      deduped FOR DISPLAY, with the collapsed count shown, because the
      duplication in the ledger is real and hiding it would be worse.
v4.2  2026-08-24  r111: the PRE-OPEN REHEARSAL state is on the status board, RED
      with a flag emoji while it is running. The box reads its OWN flag off its
      OWN disk — three revisions were spent on a control-side marker standing in
      for this fact, and it disagreed with the boxes the first time it mattered.
      ANSI is emitted unconditionally: this output is read THROUGH `fleet.py
      run`, so stdout is a pipe, and an isatty gate would strip the colour in
      exactly the place the operator reads it.
v4.1  2026-08-25  r65 EXORCISM: every mention of the retired classification
      system removed - identifiers, comments, docstrings, schema. The word
      does not appear in this tree. Full accounting: REMOVAL_LOG (delivery).

Box status summary.

v4.0  2026-08-19  Ported from options_trader_v3 at the OTV4 split.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
Dated release framing and trivia are stripped; what remains is the
reasoning behind the thresholds, the design guarantees, and the
defects that recur when forgotten. WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires
this block be read before the file is edited.

status.py — Live bot status snapshot. v1.13
daily-loss banner (relabeled in the 2026-07-23 header
        audit — this entry duplicated the existing v1.12 of 2026-07-06)
        reads the limit from the LIVE unit env
        (get_runtime_env, same as Risk) instead of `from config import
        DAILY_LOSS_LIMIT_USD`, which resolved in the status process's own env
        where OT_RISK_USD is absent — so it fell back to $200 and printed a
        FALSE "DAILY LOSS LIMIT HIT / new entries halted" banner while the bot
        (systemd env) was correctly enforcing the risk-coupled limit. Same
        class of bug as v1.1's original fix; this closes the last config
        import that was env-sensitive.
v3.0 — original release
read INSTRUMENT and PAPER_TRADING from systemd env
        so status.py reflects live config, not config.py defaults
fix systemd env parsing with regex to handle long token values
remove lookahead from regex, Environment= prefix was blocking match
fix ORB state display: read structured ORB data (high/low/width/
        state/attempt) from bot.log instead of fragile string matching against
        state names that no longer exist (CONFIRMED_LONG -> OPEN_LONG, etc).
        Always show ORB H/L/width once range is set, regardless of state.
        found regardless of log line order.
        of log parsing — reliable across restarts and outside RTH.
consume the orb_range.json "status" field (ESTABLISHED/
        IN_PROGRESS/EXPIRED) instead of inventing ORB state from the clock.
        Only an ESTABLISHED range dated today is shown as live; EXPIRED and
        IN_PROGRESS ranges are labeled as such with their date, so a carried
        prior-session range can never be shown as "watching for break".
        reassessment (session continues), not a halt.
banner reflects the NET daily loss halt (day P&L <= -limit).
read authoritative orb_state.json (live engine state:
        disarm reason, break latches, price, 11:00 cutoff) instead of clock
        inference/log-scraping. Adds a live Price line, shows DISARMED (runaway
        past 50% TP) and EXPIRED truthfully, and reports price vs
        range instead of always saying "inside range, waiting".
show live Risk per trade ($ from OT_RISK_USD) under Mode.
repo-wide v3.0 bump: Yahoo-Finance purge & data stream
        mapping optimization (all market data now flows from the single
        shared TastyTrade candle feed — see data/candle_feed.py). No logic
        change in this file.
Run: python status.py
open position (with current premium & P&L), and session summary.
Read-only — never modifies anything.
