analysis/tenor_select.py  v4.0
Front / weekly / monthly expiry selection with the collision rule.

v4.0  2026-08-19  Ported from options_trader_v3 at the OTV4 split.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
Dated release framing and trivia are stripped; what remains is the
reasoning behind the thresholds, the design guarantees, and the
defects that recur when forgotten. WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires

analysis/tenor_select.py — (TERM.1)
PICK THREE EXPIRIES THAT ACTUALLY SPAN TIME.
    from analysis.tenor_select import pick_tenors
    front, weekly, monthly = pick_tenors(available_dates, today)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
WHY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Every chain snapshot collected to 2026-08-18 carries a SINGLE expiry equal to
the session date. Verified: QQQ 08-17, 76 snapshots, one expiry. That makes
**strike skew and IV level computable and TERM STRUCTURE impossible** — and
term structure is the one thing options data says about *when* the market
expects movement rather than *how much*.
⚠️ AND IT CANNOT BE BACKFILLED. Chain history is not retrievable after the
session; every day collected single-expiry is a day with no term structure,
permanently. That is the whole argument for taking it now rather than after
the current probe finishes.
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
THE RULE (operator, 2026-08-18)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    front   = 0DTE (or the nearest available if the symbol has no daily)
    weekly  = the next weekly expiry
    monthly = the monthly (third-Friday) expiry
**⚠️ AND IF THEY COLLIDE, PUSH THE COLLIDING ONE OUT to the next distinct
expiry in its own class — so the three ALWAYS span real time.**
That collision rule is the whole reason this is a module and not an inline
`sorted(dates)[:3]`. **On a monthly opex Friday, 0DTE *is* the weekly *is* the
monthly.** All three collapse to one date, term structure is undefined, and a
naive implementation reports a successful three-expiry capture while carrying
one. It is the day that produces the least information and looks the most
normal — the same shape as every silent gate this project has hit.
