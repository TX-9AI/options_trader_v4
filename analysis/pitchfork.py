v4.1  2026-08-21  _epoch_triple no longer proposes a P2 inside the last k
      bars - it was selecting the tail RUNNING EXTREME, which the 4.4
      confirmation-lag guard was then obliged to reject. Contained-fork build

Andrews pitchfork / containment envelope construction.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
Dated release framing and trivia are stripped; what remains is the
reasoning behind the thresholds, the design guarantees, and the
defects that recur when forgotten. WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires

analysis/pitchfork.py — options_trader_v3 — v1.3
PF.2: §4.3.6 CONTAINMENT ANCHOR.
        The operator's construction: "start at the present date and go
        backwards, and anything that falls out of the channel is not included in
        this pitchfork." That INVERTS §4.3 — instead of selecting three pivots
        and hoping the resulting channel fits, CONTAINMENT DEFINES THE EXTENT
        and the anchors follow from it.
        ⚠️ IT REMOVES A PARAMETER RATHER THAN ADDING ONE. §4.3's RECENCY (R=40)
        imposes ONE timescale on every symbol; the operator's objection was that
        "some forks are gonna be shorter than other ones — some will be a week
        old, some months, based on magnitude of moves." Under containment the
        span is an OUTPUT. Measured, identical parameters: NVDA 1h 12 bars,
        SPX 1h 32, SMCI 1h 139 — one rule, three epochs.
        ⚠️ AND IT BUILDS WHERE §4.3 REFUSES EVERYTHING. On the 30-day tapes the
        pivot rule returns SEPARATION / STRUCTURAL / FEWER_THAN_3 on all six
        symbol-timeframes tested; containment builds SMCI 1d at 100% of closes
        contained with price at 42% of channel, SMCI 1h 100%, SPX 1h 97%.
        ⚠️ EVIDENCE FOR THE VARIANT — §12 listed it as an OPEN QUESTION
        ("Modified Schiff is reasoned, not evidenced"): on SMCI daily
        modified_schiff contains 100% while raw ANDREWS produces no contained
        fork at all. The steep-median pathology §3.2 predicted, now measured.
        ⚠️ DETERMINISM PRESERVED — the whole bet. No judgement, no per-symbol
        tuning: the scan returns the FIRST (longest) window whose channel
        contains min_share of closes.
        ⚠️ NVDA CORRECTLY RETURNS NOTHING on a one-way move: seven bars straight
        up off the low with no reaction. You cannot draw a fork on a straight
        line — you need the first pullback. That is not a failure.
        §4.3's path is UNCHANGED and still the default for build_fork().
§4.3.5 UNIQUENESS READING, SHIPPED DARK (default OFF).
        AW measured hourly-fork coverage at 10.1% mean / 5.3% MEDIAN / 0.0% min
        across 29 symbols, and SEPARATION is 39.8% of all rejections — by far
        the largest single cause. v1.1 read §4.3.5 as take-the-last-three-and-
        test: `alt[-3:]`, and if any filter rejected it, no fork at all. The
        other reading is scan back for the most recent triple that SATISFIES
        the filters. Both are readings of the same sentence; neither changes a
        threshold, so this does NOT touch §10's overfitting surface.
        NO NEW PARAMETER, and the reason is worth stating because it is what
        makes the scan legitimate: RECENCY (R bars, measured on CONFIRMATION)
        already bounds how far back a triple can qualify, and `alt` is ordered
        in time, so once a candidate fails RECENCY every older candidate fails
        it too. The scan terminates on the existing filter rather than on a
        depth limit somebody would have to choose.
        SHIPPED OFF (`uniqueness_scan=False`) so the two readings can be run
        head-to-head on identical tape before either becomes the default —
        the fork is weight 0 and gates nothing, so there is no cost to
        measuring first. `last_scan_depth()` reports how many candidates were
        tried, which is how the audit tells a scan that helped from one that
        merely ran.
        Look-ahead is unaffected: candidates are drawn from the same
        already-confirmed pivot list, so scanning back can only reach pivots
        that were knowable at now_idx.

REJECTION REASONS. build_fork returned a bare None, so when
        a2_rail_drift found 1,030 ticks with no usable fork there was no way to
        tell WHY: a corpus too short to contain a qualifying triple, or §4.3
        filters too tight for a ~105-bar hourly series. Those have opposite
        responses — wait for sessions to accrue, vs revisit the priors. Every
        return-None path now records a reason in `last_reject_reason()`.
        Additive only: no filter, threshold or geometry changed, and the return
        contract is unchanged. Read by tests/pitchfork_filter_audit.py.
first construct. Deterministic anchor selection, three
        variants in parallel, rails as anchor + slope*(bars from anchor).
WHY THIS IS A PERSISTENT OBJECT AND NOT AN INDICATOR
    Every level the system trades against today is horizontal or static — BB,
    VWAP, named pools, ORB boundaries, fixed-% stops. A trend is a SLOPED
    CHANNEL and nothing in the system represents one.
    Deeper than that: an indicator recomputes from a window each tick and
    remembers nothing, so the bot can never hold a belief about its environment
    across time. A fork is an assertion — "this channel is in effect until
    invalidated" — which is what recognition means here. Three properties follow,
    and none of them are optional:
      RECONSTRUCTIBLE   Anchor selection is a PURE FUNCTION of the tape, so fork
                        state can always be rederived from bars. State that
                        cannot be rederived is where errors compound invisibly.
                        Unlike the L2 integrator's path-dependent book,
                        persistence here is a startup optimisation, NOT a
                        correctness requirement. Do not trade this away later for
                        a heuristic that looks better on a chart.
      HONEST ABOUT TIME §4.4's confirmation-lag rule is enforced structurally, not
                        by convention: a fork is born at index(P2) + k bars and
                        `born_idx` is computed, never passed in. A swing low is
                        not knowable until k bars after it prints, and a backtest
                        that anchors at the pivot's own timestamp is fiction.
      SELF-DESCRIBING   Every Fork carries its anchors, variant, birth index, the
                        lag applied, and the filters it passed. What the bot
                        claims to see has to be auditable rather than asserted.
WHY THIS MODULE DEFINES ITS OWN SWING PIVOTS — and the ugly part, stated plainly
    The white paper §4.1 says LiquidityMapper already computes swing pivots and
    that the overlay consumes those rather than introducing a second definition.
    **That is not true at HEAD, and the paper needs correcting.** LiquidityMapper
    computes equal-high/low PRICE CLUSTERS (_find_pools), sweeps and named session
    levels — no fractal pivot anywhere. The real implementation is
    utils.math_utils.find_swing_highs/lows, consumed by StructureAnalyzer.
    Consuming that shared helper was considered and rejected for THREE reasons:
      1. SEGREGATION. find_swing_highs feeds StructureAnalyzer ->
         structure_sequence -> a HARD VETO in regime_confluence._trending, plus
         the A4 invariant. Putting pitchfork evolution inside a function the live
         gate reads makes every PF.2/PF.3 anchor tweak a diff against the trading
         path. A definition owned by this module can change freely for six weeks
         and can be DELETED outright if the overlay does not earn its keep.
      2. THE FREEZE. L2.6 protects L1/L2/entry BEHAVIOUR. A weight-0 object is
         genuinely outside it; editing a helper the veto reads is arguably inside.
      3. IT WOULD BE A DIFFERENT DEFINITION ANYWAY. The paper needs a FIXED k
         (2 daily, 3 hourly). _find_swings uses `lb = min(SWING_LOOKBACK,
         len(highs)//4)` — fractal order DERIVED FROM FRAME LENGTH, so anchors
         would shift as the frame grows. That is §4.4's failure mode arriving
         through a different door.
    DEFECT FOUND IN THE SHARED HELPER, NOT FIXED HERE, DELIBERATELY FILED:
    utils.math_utils.find_swing_highs tests `prices[i] == max(window)` — float
    equality. On equal highs it emits BOTH bars as pivots, which would break the
    alternation a P0/P1/P2 triple depends on. It also affects StructureAnalyzer's
    swing sets today, so fixing it changes structure_sequence, which changes
    TRENDING's veto, which changes what gets traded — three weeks before go-live.
    It is a real defect and it is written down rather than routed around; the fix
    belongs post-freeze. This module simply does not inherit it (see _pivots).
    ATTRIBUTION RISK this creates, and the mitigation: if the fork uses different
    pivots, a credit improvement at PF.3 could come from the better pivots rather
    than the fork geometry. Mitigated the same way the paper handles Schiff vs
    Modified Schiff — log BOTH pivot sets in parallel during shadow and record
    which triple each would select, so PF.3 attributes with data instead of
    argument. `pivots_shared()` exists for exactly that comparison.
WHY SLOPE IS PER BAR, NOT PER SECOND
    A pitchfork is drawn on a chart, and charts compress non-trading time. In
    wall-clock space a daily fork's slope would be diluted by every weekend and
    holiday, and the rails would sag away from price across a long gap. Slope is
    therefore RISE PER BAR on the anchor timeframe, and rails are evaluated at a
    bar index. `rail_at_time()` maps a timestamp to an index against the same
    frame the fork was built from, so callers can still ask in time terms.
NOT IMPLEMENTED HERE, ON PURPOSE
    Lifecycle/invalidation (§5), multi-fork resolution (§6) and every consumer in
    §7 are later phases. §12 names CONSUMER SPRAWL as a headline risk and this
    project has already paid for it once. This file computes geometry and stops.

    # this fix and 28/40 after** — the loss is the frames whose post-P1 extreme
    # is younger than k, where EVERY candidate window gets discarded. On one
    # such frame (seed 7): 19 windows produced a triple, p2.idx was the final
    # bar in all 19, and zero containment shares were ever computed.

    # timeframe-key mismatch in pitchfork_observer meant rails were never
    # fetched at all. This fix raises the fork's build rate; that one was the
    # reason "no usable daily pitchfork (rails=absent)" printed on every box.

    # ⚠️ TWO INDIVIDUALLY-CORRECT RULES, JOINTLY FATAL. The selector was not
    # wrong to want the tail's extreme and §4.4 was not wrong to refuse an
    # unconfirmed pivot. The defect is that the selector proposed a candidate
    # the validator was obliged to reject. The fix serves §4.4's INTENT — do

    WHY THIS EXISTS, and it is the operator's construction (2026-08-11): "start
    at the present date and go backwards, and anything that falls out of the
    channel is not included in this pitchfork." That inverts §4.3: instead of
    selecting three pivots and hoping the resulting channel fits the tape,
    CONTAINMENT DEFINES THE EXTENT and the anchors follow from it.

    ⚠️ IT ALSO REMOVES A PARAMETER RATHER THAN ADDING ONE. §4.3's RECENCY (R=40)
    imposes ONE timescale on every symbol. The operator's objection: "some forks
    are gonna be shorter than other ones — some will be a week old, some months,
    based on magnitude of moves. They're going to vary." Under containment the
    span is an OUTPUT. Measured on the same tapes with identical parameters:
    NVDA 1h span 12 bars, SPX 1h 32, SMCI 1h 139 — three epochs, one rule.

    ⚠️ AND IT BUILDS WHERE §4.3 REFUSES. On SMCI daily the pivot-selection path
    returns SEPARATION at every k (the legs a trader would draw are 4 and 2 bars
    apart, inside 2k+1); the containment path returns a fork with 100% closes
    contained and price at 42% of channel.

    ⚠️ EVIDENCE FOR THE VARIANT, which §12 listed as an OPEN QUESTION ("Modified
    Schiff is reasoned, not evidenced"): on SMCI daily modified_schiff contains
    100% while raw andrews produces NO contained fork — the steep-median
    pathology §3.2 predicted, now measured rather than argued.

    DETERMINISM IS PRESERVED — the whole bet of §4.3. No judgement, no
    per-symbol tuning: scan starts from the oldest bar and returns the FIRST
    (hence longest) window whose channel contains `min_share` of closes.

    ⚠️ KNOWN LIMITATION, stated because it decides how to read the output: the
    longest containing window on a SHORT frame is often just "the whole frame".
    Whether this segments into genuine epochs needs the ~84 daily bars the boxes
    actually hold, which is why TIMEFRAMES["1d"]["candles"] had to be raised —
    the store had the history all along and the engines were handed 10 bars.
