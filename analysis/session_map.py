analysis/session_map.py  v1.0
v1.0  2026-08-26  r146 — MIGRATED out of `derived/plans.py` (r126-r145), where
      the operator's ruling lived inside a mirror of the strategies that no
      strategy ever read. It now lives where the strategies can call it, and
      `strategy/plan.py` consults it on every credit-spread level before a
      short strike is priced. Logic is the ruling verbatim; the only change is
      that it is CONSUMED.

THE SHARED SESSION MAP — the geometry that invalidates a level.

🔴 THE CENTER IS THE 5-MINUTE ORB RANGE, NOT THE OPENING PRICE. Operator,
2026-08-25: *"Why don't we use the five minute ORB range as the marker? Levels
have to be above the ORB or below to count and they have to be the right
kind."* A ZONE rather than a POINT: a level a few cents from the open is not
meaningfully above or below anything, and the first five minutes routinely
straddle it. A level OUTSIDE the opening range has actually been left behind
by the session's first move. Levels INSIDE the range are neither ceiling nor
floor and are eliminated as such.

⚠️ CONSEQUENCE: THE MAP CANNOT EXIST BEFORE 09:35 ET. Until today's opening
range closes there is no marker — not an empty map, NO map. `classify()`
returns UNMEASURED (None) in that case rather than a verdict, and the plan
records it as such. A geometry check that cannot run must never read as a
pass.

🔴 THE ORIGINAL RULING, 2026-08-25, verbatim: *"The mapper for our session
highs and lows, which are liquidity zones, and the forks have to SHARE A MAP.
Center of the map is gonna be where price currently sits at the open. There
are gonna be some levels above the price that are identified by either
session levels or fork tines. And the same will be below it. The levels below
are the only ones that can be the FLOOR and the levels above are the only
ones that can be the CEILING. No other combination will work."*

⚠️ AND THE CLARIFICATION THAT FOLLOWED. A first reading was "position governs,
the label is only provenance" — so an upper tine that drifted below the open
would become a FLOOR candidate. The operator corrected it: *"an upper tine
below the current open is UNUSABLE as a candidate. It would have to go to the
lower tine to qualify for the put credit spread. Upper tines can only be call
credit spreads, but would be INVALIDATED BY GEOMETRY if they are below the
open."*

⇒ THE TWO FACTS MUST AGREE, AND DISAGREEMENT ELIMINATES:
    ROLE comes from the SOURCE and never changes — an upper tine and a
    session HIGH are CEILINGS (call credit spreads) for the whole session; a
    lower tine and a session LOW are FLOORS (put credit spreads).
    POSITION is measured against the OPENING RANGE, frozen at 09:35.
    A ceiling at or below the range is INVALID. A floor at or above it is
    INVALID. Neither is re-cast as the other side — the displaced upper tine
    does not become the floor; the LOWER tine is the floor, or there is none.

⚠️ THIS IS WHY IT IS STRUCTURAL RATHER THAN A GATE. An inverted condor (PCS
above, CCS below) cannot be CONSTRUCTED from this map, so nothing downstream
has to detect one. It also removes a defect the old builders reproduced and
credit_edge had recorded weeks earlier: pricing a short call beyond an "upper"
tine that had drifted below spot — an ITM short call, something nobody would
sell.

⚠️ THE FORK THESIS, so it is not lost with the file it was written in.
Operator, 2026-08-25: *"The tines are what's of value, not the channel.
Tapping a tine is the trigger for selecting a short strike just outside the
channel. That's the level, but sloped."* No traversal/span gate. Both
timeframes (1h, 1d) valid — *"the hourly is valid too. Same rationale."*
