analysis/pitchfork_lifecycle.py  v4.0
Fork birth, persistence and invalidation.

v4.0  2026-08-19  Ported from options_trader_v3 at the OTV4 split.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
Dated release framing and trivia are stripped; what remains is the
reasoning behind the thresholds, the design guarantees, and the
defects that recur when forgotten. WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires
this block be read before the file is edited.

analysis/pitchfork_lifecycle.py — options_trader_v3 — v1.4
carries pitchfork v1.2's `uniqueness_scan` through to
        build_fork. Additive: the flag defaults False, so with it off this file
        behaves exactly as v1.3 did. It exists because COVERAGE IS A PROPERTY OF
        THE SEQUENCE, not of any single bar — measuring the §4.3.5 scan on the
        stateless birth walk alone would answer a different question than the
        one AW asked, and AS's whole lesson was that a birth rate presented as
        coverage is what made the fork look 33x better than it is.
PF/AS. §5 of docs/WHITEPAPER_pitchfork_overlay.md — the fork HOLDS UNTIL
INVALIDATED. Weight 0. Consumed by nothing, gating nothing.
TOUCH events now say WHICH RAIL, and whether price was above
        or below it going in. v1.0-v1.2 logged a bare "rail interaction", which is
        useless for the one thing §5.2 says the overlay exists to produce: "tagging
        the median or either tine is NOT invalidation — those are the TRADEABLE
        EVENTS". Upper, median and lower are three different hypotheses (resistance,
        mean-reversion anchor, support) and pooling them would average a bounce
        against a rejection.
        APPROACH SIDE is recorded too, because a rail touched from BELOW and one
        touched from ABOVE are opposite trades even on the same rail.
        This is the input to the touch-outcome study — the highest-yield thing
        available without waiting for the daily series (AP), since the hourly fork
        produced 162 TOUCH events against only 33 births.
+adverse_mode="pivot". §5.3(b) AS WRITTEN CANNOT WORK FOR A
        SLOPED OBJECT, and the sweep proved it by failing to improve: across the
        whole N x D grid adverse-tine stayed dominant (88.9% -> 56.5%, never under
        50%) while deaths barely moved (27 -> 23). A magnitude problem collapses
        when you loosen the threshold. This asymptotes, which means the FORM is
        wrong.
        TWO THINGS ARE WRONG WITH THE FORM, and I first claimed only one of them
        and overstated it. Recording both, and the correction.
        (i) IT IS TIME-DEPENDENT. All three rails share the fork's slope, so a
            BULLISH fork's LOWER rail RISES: price does not have to weaken to end
            up beyond it, it only has to stand still. MEASURED on a fixture with a
            long flat tail — closes mode DIED after 43 bars of perfectly
            stationary price, zero adverse movement; pivot mode HELD.
            MY OVERSTATEMENT, corrected: I first said "N=2 is the rule and 1.9
            bars is the geometry, the same number". That arithmetic assumed price
            sits ON the rail. It does not — at birth price sat 2.36 ABOVE the
            lower rail, so the climb takes (gap + margin)/slope ~= 11 bars there
            and 43 on the measured fixture. The effect is real and the direction
            was right; the magnitude was not.
        (ii) AND IT IS THE DOMINANT ONE: COUNTING CLOSES IS NOISE-SENSITIVE.
            Observed p50 life on real tape is FIVE bars, far faster than (i) alone
            can produce. Two consecutive hourly closes 0.25 ATR beyond a rail is
            an ordinary retracement, not a structural event. That is what makes
            88.9% of deaths adverse-tine, and no amount of loosening fixes it
            because a bigger N still counts the same kind of thing.
        THE FIX IS A DIFFERENT QUESTION. As specified the condition asks "is price
        beyond the rail?" For a persistent object it should ask "has price
        ESTABLISHED itself beyond the rail?" — and the fork already owns the right
        primitive, since it is anchored on fractal pivots. adverse_mode="pivot"
        invalidates when a CONFIRMED PIVOT forms beyond the counter tine. Same
        _pivots machinery, one lineage, and it inherits §4.4's confirmation lag
        rather than fighting it.
        Corroborating evidence: the 3 structural deaths are rare precisely because
        P0 violation is ALREADY pivot-anchored. The one condition tied to
        structure rather than to a moving line is the one that behaves.
        SHIPS OFF — default stays "closes" so the two are measurable side by side.
        Switching §5.3(b) is a separate, deliberate act.
coverage() UNDERCOUNTED SUPERSESSION CHAINS. It paired only
        BORN→INVALIDATED, but a supersession emits SUPERSEDED then BORN, so each
        new BORN overwrote the open span without banking it and every held bar
        before the LAST fork vanished. On a churn-heavy frame it reported 1.8%
        coverage against a 42.2% birth rate — coverage below the birth rate is
        arithmetically impossible and would have read as the fork being MORE
        starved than before lifecycle existed. Caught by running it, not reading
        it.
first lifecycle. Birth, persistence, the four invalidation
        conditions, and the acceleration asymmetry.
        A SPENT TRIPLE CANNOT RE-BIRTH, and the tests are what found it. The
        first cut retired a fork and then, on the SAME bar, called build_fork —
        which still saw the same qualifying P0/P1/P2 and handed back an identical
        fork. A structural break killed it and it reincarnated instantly. §5.1 is
        precise: birth is "at P2 CONFIRMATION", a specific bar, not "whenever a
        triple qualifies". So the retired fork's P2 index is remembered and the
        next birth requires a STRICTLY NEWER P2. Without lifecycle tests this
        would have shipped and every invalidation would have been a no-op.
WHY THIS EXISTS — the bug it fixes is mine, and it invalidated a measurement
    PF.1 shipped geometry only and said so ("this file computes geometry and
    stops"). Then `tests/a2_rail_drift.py` called `build_fork` once per hourly bar
    and used the result only when it returned non-None. `build_fork` is STATELESS
    — it recomputes from scratch every call — so that treated the fork as a
    PER-BAR INDICATOR, which is precisely what §5.2 says it is not:
        "The fork holds until invalidated. It is explicitly *not* recomputed each
         bar, each tick, or each session."
    The filter audit then measured 156 forks from 2,297 attempts and called it
    6.8%. That is the BIRTH RATE, not coverage. 156 births across 29 symbols is
    ~5 anchor events per symbol in three weeks — entirely reasonable for a
    PERSISTENT object. With lifecycle, one fork born at hour 20 covers hours 20 →
    invalidation, which can be days. Predictor 2's starvation (n=78, REFUSED at
    every horizon) is expected to be a consequence of that error rather than a
    property of the data.
    This is also the persistence mandate made literal: the fork is the bot
    asserting "this channel is in effect until something ends it". A per-bar
    recompute cannot hold a belief across time, and holding beliefs across time
    is the whole point.
RECONSTRUCTIBLE FROM TAPE — the property everything else rests on
    `replay()` walks a frame bar by bar and produces the complete fork history
    deterministically. Same bars in, same history out, always. So tracker state
    is never load-bearing: it can always be rederived, which is what separates
    this from the L2 integrator's path-dependent book. Persistence to disk would
    be a startup optimisation, never a correctness requirement. Do not trade that
    away later for a heuristic that looks better on a chart.
THE FOUR CONDITIONS (§5.3), and the one that is NOT a condition
    (a) STRUCTURAL BREAK — a close beyond P0 in the invalidating direction
        (bullish: close < P0.price). The leg that defined the fork is gone, so is
        the fork. Strongest and cleanest.
    (b) ADVERSE TINE BREAK — N consecutive anchor-timeframe closes beyond the
        COUNTER-TREND tine by >= D x ATR. N=2, D=0.25 as the paper's priors.
    (c) SUPERSESSION — a newer qualifying triple with a more recent P2 AND
        materially different geometry. The material-difference guard is what
        prevents churn; without it every marginal new pivot re-anchors.
    (d) STALENESS — no rail interaction within Z x ATR for W bars. **SHIPS OFF.**
        §5.3(d) says measure before enabling, so it is implemented, defaulted
        off, and left off until shadow data justifies it.
    **TAGGING A RAIL IS NOT INVALIDATION.** §5.2: those are the tradeable events
    the overlay exists to produce. A fork that dies when price touches it has
    inverted its own purpose.
    **AND BREAKING THE TREND-SIDE TINE IS ACCELERATION, NOT INVALIDATION.**
    Andrews' own teaching, and §5.3 is emphatic: a bullish fork closing above its
    UML is not wrong, it is UNDERSTATING the move. Flagged as an event, never
    fatal. This asymmetry is the single easiest thing to get backwards — a naive
    "price left the channel, kill it" rule would kill forks on exactly the moves
    they called correctly.
PARAMETERS NOT GIVEN BY THE PAPER
    §5.3(c) specifies "slope differing by > X%" and "median displaced by > Y x
    ATR" without values. Pre-registered here as X=25%, Y=1.0 — deliberately loose,
    because the guard exists to stop churn and a tight guard defeats it. §10 names
    the ten-parameter surface as a headline overfitting risk, so these are PRIORS
    to be measured against, not fitted.
