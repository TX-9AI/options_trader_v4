analysis/tenor_publish.py  v4.0
Publishes narrow ATM bands for the auxiliary tenors.

v4.0  2026-08-19  Ported from options_trader_v3 at the OTV4 split.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
Dated release framing and trivia are stripped; what remains is the
reasoning behind the thresholds, the design guarantees, and the
defects that recur when forgotten. WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires

analysis/tenor_publish.py — (TERM.1 part 2)
PUBLISH A NARROW ATM BAND FOR THE AUXILIARY TENORS.
    from analysis.tenor_publish import publish_aux_tenors
    publish_aux_tenors(store_path, chain_map, spot, today)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
WHY NARROW, AND WHY THAT IS THE WHOLE DESIGN
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
**Term structure needs ATM IV per tenor. It does not need the chain.**
The front expiry subscribes ~250 contracts because the bot TRADES it — it needs
strikes, walls, GEX, a delta ladder. The auxiliary tenors are archival: the only
question asked of them is *"what is implied vol at the money, out at this
date."* That is answerable from a handful of strikes around spot.
⚠️ THE COST DIFFERENCE IS THE REASON THIS IS AFFORDABLE AT ALL:
    full chains x3   ~750 subscriptions/box
    ATM bands  x2    ~270 subscriptions/box   ← this
`options_chain` v3.1 measured TastyTrade's unpublished concurrent-session cap
near **~40**, which is why the per-box streamer was removed entirely and the
store-reader architecture exists. And SPX has already been **OOM-killed at 419
MB** once on chain volume. Tripling subscriptions would walk straight back into
both. A narrow band does not.
⚠️ AND IT WRITES ONLY TO `chain_subs_aux`. `chain_subs` is `CHECK (id = 1)` and
belongs to the bot's own expiry. Nothing here can alter what the trading path
subscribes to; `candle_feed` v3.15 unions the aux rows and **fails open** if
this module never runs, writes garbage, or goes stale.
