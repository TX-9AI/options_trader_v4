analysis/liquidity_ledger.py  v4.0
Per-level touch / hold / breach accounting across the session.

v4.0  2026-08-19  Ported from options_trader_v3 at the OTV4 split.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
Dated release framing and trivia are stripped; what remains is the
reasoning behind the thresholds, the design guarantees, and the
defects that recur when forgotten. WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires
this block be read before the file is edited.

analysis/liquidity_ledger.py — options_trader_v3 — v1.1 — AUDIT A2: THE RECORD
        NOW SURVIVES THE RESTART IT EXISTS TO OUTLIVE, AND NO CLOSED BAR IS
        SKIPPED.
audit #2 fixes:
        (A2.3) `reset_for_session` cleared with no load-back — `write()` was
        a writer with NO READER, so every bake wiped the day's touch/hold/
        breach counts and the next write overwrote the good file with zeros
        (reproduced: (1,1) -> (0,0) across a restart). Reset now HYDRATES
        from the same-date JSON first, then merges the caller's seeds
        through add_level (which dedupes). Guards: schema_version and
        touch_tol_pct must match the running process — counts taken under a
        different zone mean something else (LIQ.7) and start clean, loudly.
        (A2.4) the wiring fed only `iloc[-2]` behind a single-stamp guard;
        any tick slower than ~75s silently DROPPED closed bars — and slow
        ticks correlate with busy tape, so the undercount landed exactly on
        the bars most likely to test levels (reproduced). Bar selection now
        lives HERE: `feed_frame(df_1m)` walks every closed bar newer than
        `last_bar_ts` (persisted, so the A2.3 hydrate also recovers the
        bake gap from the 60-bar 1m frame), skips the forming last row,
        and admits only this session's RTH bars (>= 09:30 ET, session
        date) — the session record stays a session record.
THE MISSING OBJECT. `LiquidityMapper.analyze()` opens with
        `lmap = LiquidityMap()` and re-derives every pool from the candle window
        on EVERY CALL. Nothing survives a tick, so:
          · `touch_count` is NOT a running count — it is `len(cluster)`, i.e.
            how many bars in the lookback happened to sit at that level when the
            map was last rebuilt. A floor price hammers into five times today
            does not accumulate.
          · `swept` / `rejection_confirmed` are per-build snapshots. Same defect
            class LIQ.3 already fixed one level down, where `closes_beyond` was
            a birth-time snapshot that had to become a per-tick question.
          · a clean SINGLE-touch low that price respects three times never
            becomes a pool at all — `_find_pools` requires >=2 equal bars within
            EQUAL_LEVEL_PCT.
        So there was no object that could answer "is this floor holding?", and
        nothing was archived: the input to every named-level decision existed
        only in RAM. Same class as the chain archive before 2026-07-23.
        OPERATOR'S SPEC, 2026-08-13, verbatim on the part that matters:
        *"the wick counts as a touch, but only a close counts as acceptance or
        rejection."* Hence THREE counters per level, never one — `touches`
        (wick), `holds` (closed back on the origin side), `breaches` (closed
        beyond). A single number cannot say whether a level is being defended
        or given up, which is the entire question.
        *"It should live on the standalone bot boxes."* Written per-box under
        `data/liquidity_ledger/<date>/<SYMBOL>.json`, next to the chain archive
        and by the same convention. The bot owns its own level book; control is
        a consumer, never the source.
        RESET AT RTH OPEN, seeded with PDH/PDL and the prior session's extremes,
        carrying at least MIN_LEVELS_PER_SIDE highs and lows.
⚠️ FIRE-AND-FORGET. Every public entry point swallows every exception. A ledger
   failure must never reach the trading loop — `chain_snapshot.py` is the model
   and the reason: this is telemetry, and telemetry that can halt trading is a
   liability, not an asset.
⚠️ v1.0 WRITES AND DOES NOT GATE. Nothing reads this to make a decision yet.
   Prove the levels are the ones a human would have drawn before wiring them to
   anything that fires.
STATE, not an event log. The file is the CURRENT book, rewritten atomically on
change. Timing of individual touches is deliberately out of scope for v1 — the
counts are what the floor thesis needs, and an append log can be added later
without changing this schema.
