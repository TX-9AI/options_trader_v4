analysis/orb_engine.py  v4.2
v4.2  2026-08-25  r65 EXORCISM: every mention of the retired classification
      system removed - identifiers, comments, docstrings, schema. The word
      does not appear in this tree. Full accounting: REMOVAL_LOG (delivery).


v4.1  2026-08-21  r60: re-arm check reads ORB_NO_ENTRY_AFTER_ET, not the
      deleted global cutoff.
      deleted - doubly dead (label never assigned, and the constant that
      negated them is gone).
Opening range: establish, latch, arm, expire.

v4.0  2026-08-19  Ported from options_trader_v3 at the OTV4 split.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
Dated release framing and trivia are stripped; what remains is the
reasoning behind the thresholds, the design guarantees, and the
defects that recur when forgotten. WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires
this block be read before the file is edited.

analysis/orb_engine.py — Opening Range Breakout state machine.
STALE-RETEST TIMEOUT RESTORED, CORRECTED (supersedes v3.8's
        removal; per user spec same day). The window's only job: after a break,
        call the retest STALE once ORB_MAX_RETEST_BARS real 1-minute bars pass
        with no confirm (not far enough to be a runaway). Fixes vs pre-v3.8:
        (1) TICK-COUNTING BUG — the old counter incremented every 15-second
        engine tick, not per bar (journal: one candle logged 4x), so 12 "bars"
        expired in ~3 minutes; now dedupes on the candle timestamp
        (last_retest_bar_ts) and counts true bars. (2) NON-TERMINAL — expiry
        now calls _rearm() (WAITING_FOR_BREAK) instead of a dormant
        INVALIDATED; a fresh close beyond either level starts a new attempt
        with a fresh window. Timing: the break candle is excluded from the
        count, so with ORB_MAX_RETEST_BARS=12 the stale signal fires on the
        13th post-break bar — a 13-minute window. Runaway stays terminal;
        close_inside re-arm
        unchanged. Day-zero SMH replay under these rules: pre-10:00 attempt
        goes stale ~10:12 OR dies close_inside, either way 10:06's fresh break
        re-arms and 10:07's confirm FIRES the short.
RETEST TIMEOUT REMOVED (structural defect, user spec): the
        ORB_MAX_RETEST_BARS=12 timeout invalidation retired an armed side on a
        CLOCK, not a market event — and because 'timeout' was terminal (never
        re-armed), a stale expired attempt left the engine blind to a FRESH
        valid break. Day-zero cost: SMH 10:06 break + 10:07 textbook confirm
        (H 566.99 wick-in, body-high 566.59 out, close 566.50 out vs ORB low
        566.71) went untaken; journal retest_check proved the armed window
        ended 10:03:15 and never re-armed. Fix: timeout deleted from the state
        machine. ARMED now persists until one of three REAL outcomes: retest
        confirm (trade), 1m close back inside (re-arm via close_inside), or
        runaway to the 50% TP (terminal, hands to sweep). bars_since_break
        kept as journal telemetry only. ORB_MAX_RETEST_BARS no longer imported.
DEFECT G MEASUREMENT (log-only, zero gating change): the
        near-miss retest is now MEASURED, never gated, exactly as the defect
        prescribes. (1) ORBData.retest_depth_px records the confirming retest
        candle's penetration into the range (long: orb_high - low; short:
        high - orb_low) so the fired setup carries its own retest depth.
        (2) every 1-min candle examined while ARMED emits a `retest_check`
        event to analysis/signal_journal with the raw px depth (NEGATIVE =
        near-miss: the wick approached but never entered) + orb_width +
        outcome, building the depth distribution the Phase-3 ROI buckets
        need before anyone decides whether a "B-grade almost-retest" is
        worth grading. Depth is logged in PX and divided by tape ATR offline
        (ATR-relative per defect G — never a percentage; percentages scale
        into holes on high-priced instruments). Confirm/invalidate logic is
        byte-identical; the journal import is guarded and every emission is
        swallowed on failure.
defect H rename only: NO_ENTRY_AFTER_ET -> ORB_NO_ENTRY_AFTER_ET
        (import + the past_orb_cutoff test). Same constant, same (11, 0) value,
        same behaviour. NOTE the two cutoffs in this file are DIFFERENT rules and
        always were: past_orb_cutoff uses the 11:00 ORB-scoped constant, while
        is_past_entry_cutoff() (from utils.time_utils, used in notify_position_closed
        to decide EXPIRED vs re-arm) uses the 14:00 GLOBAL cutoff. The rename makes
        that distinction legible at the call site.
THE BREAK IS NOW DEFINITIONAL. Two changes, one principle:
        the setup is mechanical, so every tolerance is removed and the rule is
        stated exactly.
        (1) ORIGIN GATE now keys on the OPEN, not the wick. The impulsive candle
            must OPEN INSIDE the opening range (orb_low <= open <= orb_high) and
            CLOSE OUTSIDE it. v3.1 approximated "originates inside" as
            `low_ < orb_high` — the wick merely reaching back into the range —
            which still admitted a candle that OPENED ABOVE the range, dipped a
            wick in, and closed higher. That candle never broke out of the range;
            it was already outside it. It is late continuation, and it is not an
            OPENING-RANGE break by definition.
        (2) ORB_BREAK_BUFFER REMOVED (both the break test and the session latch).
            The buffer required the close to clear the range by 0.05% OF PRICE
            before a break registered. It filtered nothing the retest does not
            already filter — a marginal break that means nothing simply FAILS its
            retest — and, being a percentage, it scaled into a hole: $0.49 on MU,
            ~$3.00 on SPX. Price could close three full points beyond the opening
            range and the engine would not call it a break. A break is a close
            beyond the level. Full stop.
        The latch (_update_break_latches, which arms the SWEEP gate) drops the
        buffer as well, preserving its documented invariant that it uses the SAME
        threshold as _check_for_break(). The latch remains CLOSE-ONLY by design and
        does NOT take the origin gate — it records a session fact, not a setup.
        Net effect on the ORB: FEWER breaks (origin gate is strictly tighter) and
        EARLIER breaks (no buffer to clear). On the sweep gate: marginally MORE
        breaks latch, since the buffer no longer suppresses a small close-out.
        Together with v3.3 the whole setup is now free of tolerances:
            BREAK  = opens inside the range, closes outside it.
            RETEST = wick into the range, body outside it.
            STOP   = a close beyond the impulsive candle's wick.
STATE VOCABULARY CORRECTED. The state names described the
        mechanism, not the trade, and one of them collided with an unrelated
        meaning completely different things ("the ORB has no break yet" vs "the
        tape is oscillating") — a latent trap for any reader, human or model,
        holding both in view. Renamed to the operator's own vocabulary:
            WAITING                    -> NO_RANGE           (range not established)
            RANGING                    -> WAITING_FOR_BREAK  (range set, no break)
            BREAK_HIGH_AWAITING_RETEST -> ARMED_LONG         (break done, awaiting retest)
            BREAK_LOW_AWAITING_RETEST  -> ARMED_SHORT
            OPEN_LONG / OPEN_SHORT     -> unchanged (a position is live)
        ARMED means a break has occurred and the next event is FIRE or INVALIDATE.
        Before a break there is nothing armed — the engine is merely WAITING.
        Rename only: no state transition, threshold, or condition changed. The
        strings surface in orb_state.json, which main.py rewrites every tick, so
        a stale file self-heals within one poll interval (15s) — no migration.
RETEST GRACE BAND REMOVED (correctness fix, both sides).
        The retest confirm carried a percentage tolerance on the BODY test:
        long  `body_low  >= orb_high * 0.999`
        short `body_high <= orb_low  * 1.001`
        Intent was to admit a "near-miss" retest (wick approaches the range but
        does not enter) as a lower-grade setup. The code did the OPPOSITE. The
        first clause of the same condition (`low < orb_high`) ALREADY requires
        the wick to enter the range, so a true near-miss was never admitted and
        never fired. What the 0.999 actually admitted was a candle whose BODY
        CLOSED BACK INSIDE THE RANGE — by up to 0.1% — as a CONFIRMED retest.
        That is the DISARM condition, bought as an entry. And because the confirm
        branch is evaluated before the (b) close-inside branch, it won.
        Scale of the hole (percentage of price, so it grows with the instrument):
          MU  @ 971.50 range high → admitted closes down to 970.53 (~$0.97 inside)
          SPX @ 6000.00           → admitted closes ~6.0 POINTS inside the range
        The retest is the FALSIFICATION step of the break hypothesis ("this level
        is now support"). A level that was not actually tested produced no
        evidence, and a level whose retest closed back inside was tested and
        FAILED. Neither is a graded setup; both are no-trade. The test is now
        exact: wick INTO the range, body OUTSIDE it. No tolerance.
        Behavioural effect: strictly FEWER entries. Every entry removed was one
        taken on a candle that had already invalidated the setup. Verified against
        the MU 2026-07-10 reference (09:49 break / 09:50 retest / 09:55 stop):
        sequence reproduces unchanged — the reference retest's body sits fully
        outside the range and never depended on the grace.
        NOTE (future, NOT in this change): if the near-miss is to be evaluated as
        a genuine B-grade variant, it must be MEASURED, not gated — log an
        ATR-relative `retest_depth = (orb_high - candle_low) / ATR` on every setup
        (negative = near-miss) and let the Phase-3 ROI buckets decide. It belongs
        in orb_quality inside setup_scorer, never as a tolerance in the state
        machine. See ROADMAP Phase 3.
        SWEEP_REVERSAL, so a sweep label suppressed a valid ORB. Guarded by
        under a sweep label and the dispatch fires ORB (ORB wins). When off,
        behaviour is unchanged (defers to sweep). Pairs with main.py v3.2, which
        admits UNKNOWN/SWEEP_REVERSAL to the ORB dispatch. No change to the v3.1
        stop logic.
STOP PLACEMENT FIX + impulsive-candle origin gate.
        (1) The protective stop now anchors to the impulsive (break) candle's
            actual WICK — its LOW for a long, its HIGH for a short — not the
            body (min/max of open,close) it used before. When the impulsive
            candle opened outside the range, the body edge sat OUTSIDE the
            level, so the retest entry (which returns to the level) printed a
            stop on the wrong side of entry — inverted/degenerate risk. The
            wick is the true origin of the breakout move and sits inside the
            range where invalidation actually lives.
        (2) A valid impulsive candle must ORIGINATE INSIDE the range: its low
            must reach into the range for a long (low < orb_high), its high for
            a short (high > orb_low). A candle sitting entirely beyond the range
            is late continuation, not an ORB break; taking its "retest" was the
            source of the remaining inverted stops (fast/gap breaks and re-arms
            while price was extended). Gating on origin removes them.
        Verified on candle-logger tape (2026-07-09/10, 44 symbol-sessions):
        inverted-risk entries fell to 0 and the MU 2026-07-10 09:49/09:50
        reference setup reproduces exactly (stop 971.14 = impulsive low).
        Stop-LEVEL fix only; the exit TRIGGER is unchanged (see note below).
FIX (grave): break latches broke_high/broke_low are now
        maintained UNCONDITIONALLY every tick by _update_break_latches(),
        decoupled from the RANGING-only _check_for_break() path. Previously the
        latches were set solely inside _check_for_break(), which runs ONLY in
        RANGING state — so once the engine left RANGING without re-arming
        (runaway, retest-timeout, or a confirmed OPEN), it never re-checked for
        a break and the OPPOSITE-side latch could never be set. A genuine
        opposite-side 1-min CLOSE breakout after a one-sided runaway was
        therefore invisible to the sweep-reversal gate (_sweep_broke_orb),
        BLOCKING the highest-conviction failed-breakout reversals pre-11:00 —
        and the surviving same-side latch could be leaned on while stale. The
        latch is now a pure session fact ("did a 1-min candle CLOSE beyond this
        boundary this session"), independent of ORB entry state. Preserved:
        it stays CLOSE-based (a wick that pokes and closes back inside still
        does NOT arm a sweep — the AVGO-trap protection) and latch-only (set
        True; cleared solely by reset_for_session()). Fix is contained to this
        file; downstream (sweep gate + orb_state.json) reads the properties
        unchanged.
(a) session break latches broke_high/broke_low set on a
        1-min CLOSE beyond the range — these arm the sweep reversal (same break
        the ORB retest uses), so a wick poke that closes back inside no longer
        (sweeps take priority) so the engine can't get stuck in a phantom OPEN.
        (c) re-arm rule tightened to: 1-min close back inside AND before 11:00
        (runaway/timeout never re-arm).
v1.0 — original release
full state model rewrite
fix cutoff check running before range-setting
ORB range now read from orb_range.json (written by
        analysis/get_orb_range.py). Single source of truth — no external feed
        calls inside the engine, no log parsing, no circular logic.
fix _range_date comparison: now stored as string from
        JSON date field so today check works correctly and engine stops
        reloading orb_range.json every tick after range is set.
        ORB-friendly (RANGING/COMPRESSION). Do NOT re-arm after an (a) runaway
        breakout. Tracks invalidation_reason to distinguish the two.
11:00 ET HARD cutoff (expire even awaiting-retest, so the
        rules: (a) price runs to the 50% TP with no retest (runaway breakout,
        favors sweep reversal); (b) a 1m candle closes back inside the ORB
        range. Replaces the 2PM/exempt-retest behavior.
honor the orb_range.json "status" field. Only an
        ESTABLISHED range dated today is loaded and armed (WAITING->RANGING).
        EXPIRED (last RTH) and IN_PROGRESS (opening candle still forming)
        ranges are ignored for trading, so the engine can never break out on
        a carried-over prior-day range.
repo-wide v3.0 bump: Yahoo-Finance purge & data stream
        mapping optimization (all market data now flows from the single
        shared TastyTrade candle feed — see data/candle_feed.py). No logic
        change in this file.
