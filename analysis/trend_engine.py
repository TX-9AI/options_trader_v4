analysis/trend_engine.py  v4.0
ADX, EMA stack and momentum per timeframe. DIRECTION VOTE IS DESCRIPTIVE ONLY.

v4.0  2026-08-19  Ported from options_trader_v3 at the OTV4 split.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
Dated release framing and trivia are stripped; what remains is the
reasoning behind the thresholds, the design guarantees, and the
defects that recur when forgotten. WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires

analysis/trend_engine.py — Trend detection via EMA stacks, ADX, momentum. v3.3
Operates on 5m, 15m, and 1H timeframes for multi-TF trend alignment.
v1.0 — original release
STARVATION IS NO LONGER SILENT, and it was hiding a
        half-landed fix. _analyze_single() bails to NEUTRAL below EMA_SLOW+5=55
        bars and said NOTHING. Measured against live fetch depths
        (TIMEFRAMES[tf]["candles"]): 1d=10, 1h=50, 15m=50 are ALL under 55, so
        THREE OF FOUR timeframes have been voting NEUTRAL in production
        permanently — only 5m (100) can vote at all.
        That matters because v3.1's reweight on 07-16 diagnosed exactly this for
        1d/1h and moved the direction weight onto 15m (0.30) + 5m (0.35) — but
        15m fetches 50 bars too, so 0.30 of the weight it moved TO was already
        dead. The fix only half-landed, and the symptom is a silent NEUTRAL
        rather than an error, so nothing surfaced it for two weeks.
        Consequence with only 5m voting: total_weight = 0.35 + half-weight for
        each NEUTRAL frame = 0.675, so bull_score = 0.519*conviction and the
        0.30 gate needs the 5m vote above 0.579 conviction. Below that,
        overall_direction is NEUTRAL — which is a HARD VETO on TRENDING in
        regime_confluence._trending — so TRENDING is structurally unreachable and
        argmax necessarily lands on RANGING/COMPRESSION. Iron condor is the
        RANGING fallback, so it has been absorbing that deficit.
        This release adds the WARNING only; the fetch-depth change is config.py
        (15m 50 -> 150, sized so the EMA-50 has actually converged — at 55-60
        bars it is re-seeded on the tail and off by ~half a bar).
SURFACE primary_momentum ON TrendState (defect W).
        momentum was computed per-timeframe on TrendVote but NEVER aggregated
        onto TrendState, the object handed to the strategies. Any consumer
        doing getattr(trend, "momentum", "") silently got "" — no
        AttributeError, no log — which hard-blocked the trend continuation
        trade on every tick since it shipped 2026-07-18 (see
        continuation_strategy v1.1). Now surfaced from the 5m vote, exactly
        as primary_adx already is, for the same reason: 5m is the timeframe
        this bot actually trades. Default "" means "no 5m vote this tick" and
        consumers MUST treat it as no-trade, not as neutral.
primary_adx now sourced from the 5m timeframe instead
        of 1H. This is a 0DTE intraday bot trading off ORB/butterfly setups
        on 5-min structure — 1H ADX lags the actual session move and was
        causing trend days to misclassify as RANGING (ADX stuck near 0
        until the 1H candle had enough history to show directional
        persistence, which can be hours after the actual breakout fired).
repo-wide v3.0 bump: Yahoo-Finance purge & data stream
        mapping optimization (all market data now flows from the single
        shared TastyTrade candle feed — see data/candle_feed.py). No logic
        change in this file.
