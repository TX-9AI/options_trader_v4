analysis/entry_snapshot.py  v4.0
Captures the decision-time context of an entry.

v4.0  2026-08-19  Ported from options_trader_v3 at the OTV4 split.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
Dated release framing and trivia are stripped; what remains is the
reasoning behind the thresholds, the design guarantees, and the
defects that recur when forgotten. WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires
this block be read before the file is edited.

analysis/entry_snapshot.py — the entry-time structural picture, captured. v1.2
the v1.1 fix routed its logs through a helper, and the
        census still counted all five SILENT: it reads the HANDLER BODY, so a
        log behind an indirection is invisible to it. Logger calls are now
        inline; the helper only throttles. Hiding a log from the census would
        defeat the census.
NO SILENT SWALLOWS. v1.0 shipped five `except: return
        None` handlers and the nightly census (tests/swallow_audit.py, backlog
        W.2) counted every one of them as SILENT — in TIER 1, the decision-input
        tier. That is the exact pattern the operator named as the go-live risk,
        added hours after saying so. Each except now routes through _quiet(),
        which logs at DEBUG once per site per process: loud enough that a broken
        capture is findable, quiet enough that it can never spam a session or
        become the reason a fill is not recorded. Behaviour is otherwise
        byte-identical — every handler still returns exactly what it returned.
NEW. Captures, on every filled entry, the FVG zones and
        structural context AS THE LIVE ENGINE HELD THEM at that instant, so the
        TC.2 exit-mechanism bake-off (BoS vs trail vs 5m-FVG, counterfactual on
        identical entries) is computable from banked rows instead of guessed at.
        ROADMAP TC.2 names this precursor and flags it as pre-freeze safe;
        nothing in the repo produced it.
WHY IT CANNOT BE RECONSTRUCTED LATER, which is the whole argument for spending a
column on it:
  - **BoS can be** — and this file deliberately does NOT capture it. `BOSTracker`
    seeds from entry price and direction (both already on the trade row) and
    ratchets forward on closed 1m candles, so a BoS counterfactual is a pure
    function of the post-entry tape. Capturing it would be storage for nothing.
    Stated explicitly because the opposite was assumed before HEAD was read.
  - **The FVG anchor cannot.** The trail anchors to the nearest unfilled in-favor
    gap on the frame `_fvg_frame()` selects, and that frame is the LIVE rolling
    window (`TIMEFRAMES[tf]["candles"]`), which is CONTINUOUS across sessions on
    5m. A replay resampled from the banked RTH 1m tape is session-scoped, so a
    gap formed across the overnight boundary exists live and cannot exist
    offline. That is the same class of divergence defect S found in the replay's
    1m window, and it means an offline reconstruction is not the same object.
  - **Frame DEPTH cannot.** A vote taken on a starved frame is not the vote a
    warm frame would have cast (AK: three of four timeframes had never voted).
    Depth is provenance — it says whether the entry-time picture was even
    entitled to an opinion — and it is gone the moment the tick ends.
CONTRACT — this module is OBSERVABILITY ONLY.
  - It is called AFTER the fill is confirmed and the row is written. It cannot
    reach the entry decision, the size, the strike or any exit.
  - `build()` NEVER raises. A capture failure must never touch a live position;
    it returns a payload carrying `err` and the caller logs it. Silence is the
    failure mode this repo keeps paying for, so the caller gets a boolean and an
    error string rather than a swallowed exception.
  - It reads. It computes nothing the engines do not already compute, and it
    imports the exit engine's OWN gap finders rather than re-deriving them —
    a second lineage would make the counterfactual measure this file instead of
    the trail. The import is deliberately LAZY (inside the function): module-level
    it would drag the TastyTrade SDK into every offline consumer of `analysis/`,
    and the payload is read offline far more often than it is written.
PAYLOAD (JSON, one TEXT column `trades.entry_snapshot`; keys are short because
this is written once per trade and read by tooling, not by eye):
    v      schema version (int) — bump on any key change, never repurpose a key
    at     capture time, UTC ISO (same base as entry_time — never ET)
    px     underlying at capture
    dir    "long" / "short" / "neutral" (condor legs are neutral: no in-favor side)
    frame  "5m" / "1m" — the frame `_fvg_frame()` selected, i.e. the one the
           trail would actually anchor to on this tick
    anchor {t,b} of the nearest unfilled in-favor gap, or null if none existed —
           null is a REAL observation (the trail had no anchor and fell back to
           the percentage leash), not a missing value
    fvg    up to FVG_CAP most-recent gaps on the selected frame: t/b/d/i
    swing  seq / res / sup / hi / lo from the live StructureMap
    depth  bar count per timeframe as held at entry
    err    present ONLY on failure, with the exception text
