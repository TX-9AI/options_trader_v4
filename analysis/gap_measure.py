v4.1  2026-08-25  r65 EXORCISM: every mention of the retired classification
      system removed - identifiers, comments, docstrings, schema. The word
      does not appear in this tree. Full accounting: REMOVAL_LOG (delivery).

Overnight gap, measured rather than inherited as an ATR spike.

v4.0  2026-08-19  Ported from options_trader_v3 at the OTV4 split.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
Dated release framing and trivia are stripped; what remains is the
reasoning behind the thresholds, the design guarantees, and the
defects that recur when forgotten. WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires
this block be read before the file is edited.

analysis/gap_measure.py — (A2.6b live path)
MEASURE THE OVERNIGHT GAP INSTEAD OF INHERITING IT AS AN ATR SPIKE.
    from analysis.gap_measure import measure_gap
    g = measure_gap(df_5m)          # -> {"gap_pct": .., "gap_class": ..} or None

WHY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Operator, 2026-08-01: *"the gaps you see overnight from previous close to
current open are big and meaningful, and they have to be reflected somewhere."*
**They are reflected — anonymously.** `atr_series` uses proper true range with
`prev_close = close.shift(1)` and the 5m tape is continuous, so the first 5m bar
after the open carries `|high − prev_close|` and a large gap **spikes ATR
immediately**, then decays over the window. The 25-bar angle correctly never
sees it (1m is session-scoped; a regression must not span a gap).
⚠️ **NOWHERE IS THE GAP MEASURED AS ITSELF.** No `gap_pct`, no `gap_class`,
nothing conditions on it. Every consumer sees a volatility number that is
partly last night's news and cannot tell which part.
⚠️ **AND IT IS THE ONLY PRE-OPEN DECISION-TIME INPUT IN THE STACK.** Every
bars from the session to exist. The gap is **fully formed at 09:30**, before a
single RTH bar prints. If anything collected can speak before the day starts,
this is it.
⚠️ AND UNLIKE EVERYTHING ELSE THIS WEEK, IT IS **FULLY BACKFILLABLE**.
`tests/gap_backfill.py` v1.1 already computes it per (date, symbol) from banked
OHLC. This module is the LIVE path; **the classification is imported from that
tool rather than reimplemented**, so the historical and live numbers cannot
drift apart (§7 — one lineage per quantity).

    A gap of exactly zero is a real and meaningful reading — the market opened
