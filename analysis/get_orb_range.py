"""
analysis/get_orb_range.py  v4.0
Opening-range accessor with the date filter.

v4.0  2026-08-19  Ported from options_trader_v3 at the OTV4 split.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
Dated release framing and trivia are stripped; what remains is the
reasoning behind the thresholds, the design guarantees, and the
defects that recur when forgotten. WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires
this block be read before the file is edited.

#!/usr/bin/env python3
analysis/get_orb_range.py — Resolve the opening range for the instrument and
write it to orb_range.json with an explicit STATE. Always writes the last
valid range so consumers always have something to show; the state tells them
what that range represents.
CRITICAL: the opening candle is fetched through the bot's own data layer
(data.market_data.fetch_candles) — the SAME source and symbol mapping the rest
of the bot uses. As of repo v3.0 that source is the single shared
TastyTrade/DXFeed store (data/candle_feed.py), the exact tape the bot trades
on. Earlier versions fetched a DIFFERENT Yahoo symbol than the bot's feed, so
the ORB range never matched the bot's price feed or the operator's chart.
Never fetch here with a private symbol map again — always go through
fetch_candles.
Three states only (the "call-out"):
    ESTABLISHED  — today's 9:30-9:35 ET candle is closed. high/low/date are
                   today's. The only tradeable state.
    IN_PROGRESS  — now is inside today's opening candle (09:30:00-09:34:59 ET).
                   Today's range is still forming; high/low/date carry the LAST
                   valid RTH range until the candle closes.
    EXPIRED      — no today range yet (pre-open, or today's candle not on the
                   feed yet). high/low/date carry the LAST valid RTH range
                   (e.g. Friday's on a Monday pre-open).
v1.0 — original — ^GSPC via a direct Yahoo client, most-recent 9:30 candle, no guard.
strict today-only gating (wrote nothing before ready).
three-state model; always write the last valid range.
SOURCE FIX: fetch the opening candle via
        data.market_data.fetch_candles() so the range uses the identical feed
        and symbol as the bot (^SPX for SPX, not ^GSPC). Removed the private
        Yahoo import and SYMBOL_MAP entirely.
YAHOO-FINANCE PURGE / data stream mapping optimization
        (repo v3.0): no logic change — fetch_candles now reads the single
        shared TastyTrade feed store, so the 5m opening candle is the exact
        tape the bot trades on. Docstring scrubbed.
Exit codes (consumed by main._fetch_orb_range):
    0 = ESTABLISHED   1 = hard error (no data / write failure)
    2 = IN_PROGRESS   3 = EXPIRED
