analysis/second_order.py  v4.0
CHARM and VANNA from the greeks series. Tier 4 of docs/DERIVED_STORES.md.

v4.0  2026-08-22  Built with the manifold.

    charm = dDelta / dt        (per day)
    vanna = dDelta / dVol      (per 1.00 of IV)

🔴 OPERATOR: "absolutely indispensable." For 0DTE, CHARM DOMINATES THE
AFTERNOON — it is the mechanism behind pin. A 0DTE book that cannot compute
charm is ASSERTING pin risk rather than measuring it.

⚠️ NEITHER WAS COMPUTABLE BEFORE THE MANIFOLD, and not because nobody wrote the
maths: `chain_marks` is PRIMARY KEY (streamer_symbol), last-write-wins, so ~250
chain symbols ticking all session each overwrote ONE row. Both of these are
derivatives of delta OVER A SERIES. With one row there is no series and no
derivative. The greeks_series table is what makes this file possible.

⚠️ CONTRIBUTOR, NEVER A GATE. Operator's ruling: derived values inform, they
never authorise. Every function here returns None rather than raising, and a
None means "not measurable from what we have" — NEVER 0.0. A charm of zero is a
real and meaningful reading (delta is stable); a charm that could not be
computed is the absence of a reading. Conflating them is the VW.1 failure.

⚠️ FINITE DIFFERENCE, NOT A MODEL. We do not price options here. We measure how
the vendor's own delta moved against time and against the vendor's own IV. That
keeps this honest: it reports what the surface DID, not what a model says it
should have done.
