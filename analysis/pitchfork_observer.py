"""
analysis/pitchfork_observer.py  v4.0
Records fork state per tick for later analysis.

v4.0  2026-08-19  Ported from options_trader_v3 at the OTV4 split.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
Dated release framing and trivia are stripped; what remains is the
reasoning behind the thresholds, the design guarantees, and the
defects that recur when forgotten. WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires
this block be read before the file is edited.

#!/usr/bin/env python3
analysis/pitchfork_observer.py — PF.2
BOX-LOCAL PITCHFORK OBSERVATION. Builds the DAILY and HOURLY forks from the
box's OWN frames, caches them, and journals where price sits in each channel.
⚠️⚠️ EVALUATION DATE: **FRI 2026-08-14**. DELETE CRITERION: if no daily fork
builds on any box, the frame fix did not take and this overlay is inert — remove
it. Standing rule agreed 2026-08-12: an observer ships with an evaluation date
and a delete criterion, or it does not ship.
⚠️ WEIGHT 0. NOTHING GATES ON THIS. It scores nothing, vetoes nothing and is
read by no strategy. §11 of the white paper is explicit that v1 ships observing
only, and §12's stated risk is CONSUMER SPRAWL — "building more than one
application before any is proven would repeat the mistake of shipping four
engine changes into a frozen window". This module exists to answer ONE question
with data: when continuation fires, where was price relative to the rail?
WHY IT CAN SHIP DURING THE FREEZE. EPOCH 2 hands off L1/L2/entry logic Aug 17 →
Aug 30, but "everything else this epoch is offline or log-only". A weight-0
overlay that gates nothing IS log-only, so unlike the label-affecting items it
does not face the Mon Aug 17 deadline and can collect through the freeze.
⚠️ BOX-LOCAL BY DESIGN, and this is an architectural requirement, not a
convenience. Operator, 2026-08-11: "for the bots to remain independent and
modular, that has to take place on their boxes… they were designed to function
without a controller. The controller is only intended if you're running a fleet
of boxes." So the frames come from the box's own feed store, the fork is built
on the box, and the journal is written on the box. Nothing here reaches for the
control server, and a single box is complete on its own.
WHAT MADE THIS POSSIBLE TONIGHT: the boxes were found to hold **84 daily bars**
already (2026-06-11 → 08-11, verified on SPX and GLD), while
TIMEFRAMES["1d"]["candles"] handed the engines only 10. The history was never
missing — the frame was clipped. Raising that number is the whole prerequisite.
⚠️ THE ANCHOR IS §4.3.6 CONTAINMENT, NOT §4.3 PIVOT SELECTION. On the same
tapes the pivot rule refuses everything tested (SEPARATION, STRUCTURAL, or
FEWER_THAN_3_ALTERNATING_PIVOTS) while containment builds forks with 97-100% of
closes inside. Both are available; the variant and the anchor are logged on
every record so the choice is settled by data.
NEVER RAISES. Every entry point swallows, because an observation module must
not be able to affect a trading decision by failing.
