analysis/level_grade.py  v4.1
Grades a level by TYPE with a rung discount; nearest graded pool.

v4.1  2026-09-16  r383 — CFG.3 — THE RESOLVERS LAND HERE, SO THERE IS ONE
      IMPLEMENTATION AND NOT TWO. `resolve_level_strength()` and
      `resolve_gap_pct()` are the single place a trade row's level grade and gap
      are decided, called by BOTH `entry_engine.enter()` and
      `main._execute_condor_leg`. Until r383 the signal-then-ctx fallback lived
      inline in the condor path alone, so ORB and RunawayContinuation — 433 of
      493 banked trades — recorded `level_strength` 0.0 and `gap_pct` NULL while
      the values sat in `ctx`.
      🔑 None, NEVER 0.0. `nearest_graded` already refuses to collapse "no level
      within range" into "a level of zero strength"; these keep that honest all
      the way to the column. A measured-looking zero on every row is how
      `level_strength` came back from the separation probe as "levels do not
      separate outcomes" when levels had never been measured at all.
      ⚠️ NOTE FOR THE NEXT READER: the `touch_count IS A CONSTANT` warning above
      is about the OLD `sweep_reversal` formula this module REPLACES, not about
      `grade_level`, which is a pure function of the level's NAME and returns
      real differentiated values (PDH 1.0, PDH (R2) 0.9, London High (R1) 0.7,
      1h upper tine 0.15). That distinction was misread once during r383 and is
      written down here so it is not misread again.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
Dated release framing and trivia are stripped; what remains is the
reasoning behind the thresholds, the design guarantees, and the
defects that recur when forgotten. WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires

analysis/level_grade.py — (Level.1)
GRADE A LIQUIDITY LEVEL BY WHAT IT IS, NOT BY A BOOLEAN.
    from analysis.level_grade import grade_level
    strength = grade_level("PDH (R2)")        # -> 0.0 .. 1.0
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
WHY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
`trades.level_strength` came back from the separation probe as **94% ties on
TWO unique values** — read as "level strength does not separate outcomes."
It is not that. Only `sweep_reversal` writes it, and its formula is
    min(1.0, (0.6 if named else 0.2) + min(touch_count, 4) * 0.1)
⚠️ **`touch_count` IS A CONSTANT.** Named pools hardcode it to 1 at creation and
nothing ever increments it — 44,450 of 44,890 ticks read exactly 1. So the
formula collapses to **0.7 (named) or 0.3 (unnamed)**: a boolean wearing a
float's clothing. Two values, which is precisely what the probe measured.
⚠️ AND THE GRADING INPUT NOW EXISTS. Before LIQ.6 (2026-08-15) there was
nothing better to grade on. LIQ.6 gave the mapper a **three-deep ladder with
the rung in the name** — `PDH (R2)`, `NY High (R3)` — and FEED.2 (08-17)
delivered the overnight tape that makes ON High/Low real. This module was
blocked on both and is not any more.
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
THE ORDERING, AND WHY IT IS NOT FITTED
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Grades are assigned by **how much resting liquidity a level type accumulates**,
which is doctrine, not a regression on outcomes:
    prior-day extremes (PDH/PDL)   — a full session of stops, the deepest pool
    overnight extremes (ON H/L)    — a full off-hours session, thinner tape
    prior session extremes         — Asia/London closed blocks
    today's session extremes       — partial, still forming beneath it
    equal highs/lows               — a magnet, but no session behind it
⚠️ **FITTING THIS ON P&L WOULD BE THE GRADE-INVERSION ERROR AGAIN.** The setup
scorer's weights were fitted and A-grade lost $8,244 while B made $1,893. These
are STATED PRIORS from market structure. They are wrong in a way that can be
MEASURED — that is the point of emitting them.
⚠️ THE RUNG DISCOUNTS, IT DOES NOT RE-RANK. Rung 1 is the nearest untaken
liquidity; rungs 2-3 are where price runs if it takes rung 1. A deeper rung is
the same TYPE of level further away, so it keeps its class and loses a little
weight — it does not become a different kind of level.
