notifications/alert_manager.py  v4.0
Alert routing and de-duplication.

v4.0  2026-08-19  Ported from options_trader_v3 at the OTV4 split.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
Dated release framing and trivia are stripped; what remains is the
reasoning behind the thresholds, the design guarantees, and the
defects that recur when forgotten. WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires
this block be read before the file is edited.

notifications/alert_manager.py — Telegram alerts for options_trader.
v3.0 — original release (Twilio SMS)
replaced Twilio SMS with Telegram
stripped down to exactly 4 essential alerts:
        bot started, bot stopped, trade entered, trade closed (win/loss).
        Removed regime change spam and circuit breaker noise
        (circuit breaker is implied by no further entry alerts —
        operator can check status.py for the reason if curious).
added send_daily_summary(): a deliberate end-of-day P&L
        rollup sent at ~15:50 ET BEFORE the control server's shutdown sweep.
        Fee-adjusted net is the headline number. This is the 5th alert, and
        it is intentional (once/day, not spam). It is a pure formatter: the
        caller (the EOD task) computes the summary dict from the trade DB.
restart & flatten self-identification: send_startup_alert()
        carries restart_type ('fresh boot' vs 'service restart'); new
        send_recovery_alert() (a live position resumed, with box symbol and a
        CARRIED-overnight flag for a weekly held across sessions),
        send_orphan_cleared_alert() (expired ghosts swept, starting flat), and
        send_hard_close_failure_alert() (position still open past 15:45 —
        retrying to 16:00, needs a manual check). Replaces the old symbol-less
        raw _send in main.py.
broker-reconcile alerts: send_adopted_alert() (a position
        discovered open at the broker with no DB plan, now adopted+managed; a
        lone short raises it to a loud anomaly), send_phantom_closed_alert()
        (DB rows the broker no longer shows, closed), and
        send_reconcile_unavailable_alert() (broker read failed/empty — fell back
        to DB-only recovery, closed nothing).
HTML-ESCAPE EVERY OUTGOING MESSAGE. v1.9 made the drill
        honest, and it immediately caught a real one: the DRILL recovery notice
        reached Telegram on all 29 boxes while the DRILL blind alert failed on
        all 29. Same _send, same credentials, same box — the only difference was
        CONTENT. TelegramSender posts with parse_mode="HTML", so an unescaped
        `<` in the payload makes Telegram reject the whole message with a 400.
        The drill's synthetic `newest_bar=<drill>` was the trigger.
        THIS IS A PRODUCTION BUG, NOT A DRILL ARTIFACT. The blind alert
        interpolates forensic fields from record_blindness AND live position
        descriptions from trades.db — any `<`, `>` or `&` in either kills it.
        Worse, main.py's own fallback string was
        "<position read FAILED — check manually>", so a DB failure DURING a blind
        alert produced an unsendable alert: the page dies exactly when two things
        have gone wrong at once, which is when it matters most.
        Escaping is applied in _send so EVERY alert is covered, not just the two
        I happened to be looking at. Verified first that nothing in
        notifications/ uses intentional HTML markup (<b>, <code>, <a href>), so
        this changes no existing message's appearance.
_send() RETURNS WHETHER IT ACTUALLY SENT. It never did, and
        TelegramSender.send() has returned a bool since v3.0 — _send simply threw
        it away. That discarded boolean is why the blind-alert DRILL reported
        "sent" on 29 boxes while nothing left the machine: credentials live in the
        systemd unit as Environment= lines, a manual SSH run inherits none of
        them, telegram_configured() is False, send() returns False and logs at
        DEBUG, and every layer above was blind to it.
        Now _send returns the bool and send_blind_alert / send_sight_restored_alert
        propagate it, so a caller CAN check. Purely additive — every existing
        caller ignores the return and behaves exactly as before. The information
        was present at each layer and dropped at each; this stops dropping it.
send_blind_alert() / send_sight_restored_alert(): the
        operator's requirement is that ANY condition blinding the bot — the feed
        going down, stale data, a dead heartbeat, or anything else — pages
        IMMEDIATELY and logs the exact conditions that caused it. Defined on the
        SYMPTOM rather than an enumerated cause list, because a cause list only
        ever covers the failures already thought of.
        The hole it closes: `_feed_alive()` proves the PRODUCER is running, not
        that the BARS are current, so a feed writing 15-minute-stale bars passed
        every check while every engine consumed delayed data (market_data v3.3).
        Complements — does not duplicate — the existing bot/service-down
        notification: that one fires when the bot STOPS, this one fires when the
        bot KEEPS RUNNING on data it cannot trust. Process alive, service green,
        trading blind was the uncovered middle.
        With OPEN POSITIONS on a live-cash box the alert says to go to TastyTrade
        and manage them by hand. Fires in PAPER too, tagged [PAPER] and without
        that instruction — an alarm that has never fired is one nobody knows
        works, and this exercises the path daily before go-live.
        Telegram carries a compact "look now" summary; the forensic detail goes
        to the log, captured at the FIRST blind tick rather than when the latch
        trips, because by alert time the conditions have often already changed.
        RTH-ONLY by construction: the tick loop only evaluates blindness inside
        the session, so an expected outage (maintenance wake, a box deliberately
        stopped, pre-open) never reaches this channel. The operator's framing is
        that Telegram is an EMERGENCY SERVICES channel — nothing routine goes
        there, or it stops being read. Detection and the record stay on outside
        RTH; only the paging and the log level are gated.
        drill=True prefixes an unmistakable DRILL marker and is used by
        tests/blind_alert_selftest.py, which exercises this exact function.
send_regime_engine_degraded_alert(): the L2.5 integrator
        failing to import degraded all 15 boxes to the v1.3 classifier for a
        full session and announced it only as a WARNING in each box's log —
        nobody saw it until the logs were read by hand. Trading was unaffected,
        but every conviction value logged that day came from a different engine
        than the one the epoch ladder calibrates against. A silent engine swap
        is a data-integrity event, so it now pages.
send_short_leg_closed_alert(): loud alarm when an intraday
        broker check finds a SHORT leg auto-closed by the broker while the long
        remains — protection removed, now managing the long on its own.
repo-wide v3.0 bump: Yahoo-Finance purge & data stream
        mapping optimization (all market data now flows from the single
        shared TastyTrade candle feed — see data/candle_feed.py). No logic
        change in this file.
