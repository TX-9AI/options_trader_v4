# options_trader_v4/install_self_close.sh — v1.0
# v1.0 (2026-08-25) — THE BOX CLOSES ITSELF IF NOBODY ELSE DID.
#
# 🔑 TWO MODES, ONE OUTCOME. With control enabled the conductor closes the fleet
# at 16:05 and this timer fires at 16:45 on a machine that is already off —
# NOTHING HAPPENS, and that is correct, not a missed run. With control disabled
# or broken, this is the ONLY thing that closes the box, and it does the same
# work: drain, verify, halt.
#
# 🔴 IT INVERTS THE FAILURE MODE. Before, a disabled control server meant
# fifteen boxes ran all night and the operator learned it from the bill.
#
# ⚠️ IT ALSO RETIRES THE TWO BOX-SIDE EOD UNITS IT REPLACES:
#     optbot-eod-summary (15:50) — wrote pnl_today.json, which nothing reads
#                                  now that P&L comes from the warehouse
#     optbot-eod         (16:01) — the unified winddown, superseded
#
# ⚠️ candle-logger (16:05) IS LEFT ALONE deliberately: it collides with the
# conductor's start minute and the conductor QUIESCES it, but changing its
# schedule is a separate decision from this one.
#
# Run:  bash install_self_close.sh
#       bash install_self_close.sh --rollback
