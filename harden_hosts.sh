# options_trader_v3/harden_hosts.sh — v1.0
# Host hardening for a trading box. Two independent guards against the
# mid-session restarts we traced to unattended-upgrades -> needrestart on
# 2026-07-07 (optionsbot was auto-restarted 09:36–10:06 ET when a package
# upgrade ran during RTH):
#   1) needrestart drop-in: never auto-restart optionsbot after a package
#      upgrade. needrestart may LIST it, but it will not act on it. The daily
#      EC2 stop/start already cold-boots every box, so upgraded libraries are
#      picked up next morning without an in-session restart.
#   2) apt timer overrides: move apt-daily / apt-daily-upgrade to run overnight
#      ET (well outside 09:30–16:00) with Persistent=false, so a run missed
#      while the box was stopped overnight does NOT fire on the ~09:17 ET
#      morning boot (which would land right at the open).
# Idempotent: safe to run repeatedly. Requires passwordless sudo (present on
# the fleet). Deploy to the live fleet from the control server WITHOUT a bot
# restart:
#   fleet.py run "cd ~/options-trader && git fetch origin && \
#       git reset --hard origin/main && bash harden_hosts.sh"
# (Do NOT use push.sh --deploy / fleet.py update to apply this mid-session —
#  that restarts optionsbot. This script never touches the bot service.)
