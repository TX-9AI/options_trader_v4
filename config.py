config.py  v4.5
v4.5  2026-08-24  r101: ENTRY_OPEN_ET (09:35) — nothing OPENS before the opening
      range exists. Operator directive, dated, with its reason recorded beside
      the GLOBAL_NO_ENTRY_ET tombstone so the two are distinguishable.
v4.4  2026-08-25  LOCAL RETENTION POLICY DECLARED, NOT ENFORCED. Per-tenor day
    counts written down in config BEFORE any purge exists to read them, and
    COMMENTED OUT so nothing acts on them yet. The binding consumer is
    EMA_ANCHOR=200, which inverts the intuition: every tenor needs the same
    BARS, so 1m needs 5 days and 1h needs 60. A flat row cap — which is what
    candle_feed.PRUNE_KEEP_ROWS is — cannot express that. Pruning stays OFF.

v4.3  2026-08-25  r65 EXORCISM: every mention of the retired classification
      system removed - identifiers, comments, docstrings, schema. The word
      does not appear in this tree. Full accounting: REMOVAL_LOG (delivery).

v4.3  2026-08-22  CONDOR_PF_TIMEFRAME -> "1h" per operator ruling. See the
    site comment; supersedes the daily anchor.

v4.2  2026-08-21  r60: GLOBAL_NO_ENTRY_ET deleted (unauthorized 14:00
      all-strategy cutoff - see the block at its former site); TCS_ENTRY_END_ET
      added as an inert, flagged placeholder for the parked TC.6.
Every constant, threshold and env override.

v4.1  2026-08-20  AUDIT F2: TREND_CREDIT_ACTIVE default OFF - the sixth
      strategy traded live on the 34.2%-measured trend vote while its own
      doctrine said NOT DISPATCHED. See the block at the constant.
v4.0  2026-08-19  Ported from options_trader_v3 at the OTV4 split.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
Dated release framing and trivia are stripped; what remains is the
reasoning behind the thresholds, the design guarantees, and the
defects that recur when forgotten. WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires
this block be read before the file is edited.

config.py — options_trader v4.20
# L1.9a: TIMEFRAMES["1h"] 50 -> 80 candles. `trend_engine`
#   refuses to vote below EMA_SLOW+5 = 55 bars and this asked for exactly 50,
#   so the 1h trend vote COULD NEVER FIRE - and 1h carries 0.20 weight, second
#   only to 15m. Its "declared weight contributes nothing" warning has been
#   firing on every box since the engine shipped and was read as transient.
#   THIS IS WHY L1.6/L1.7 WERE STUCK: the TRENDING row needs RANGING vetoed
#   through a dominant session, and a permanently missing structure vote
#   depresses TRENDING and inflates RANGING. TSLA 08-04 had 99% dominance with
#   RANGING still scoring 64% of ticks. 26 TREND sessions labeled, row still
#   open. The roadmap called it "habit, not code". It was code.
#   80 not 55: the minimum is a cliff, not a target. Store holds ~112 RTH 1h
#   bars (16d x ~7/day) and pruning is OFF.
#   BLAST RADIUS: df_1h also feeds structure_analyzer (swings + S/R), the
#   pitchfork, entry_snapshot and the named-level frame. A POPULATION BOUNDARY.
OPERATOR DIRECTION, mirrored from options_trader_smc so
        the two arms stay comparable: (1) MAX_LOSS_PCT 0.40 -> 0.25, which
        tightens `stop_hit` (sweep), `hard_stop` (ORB) and the ADOPTED stops
        via ADOPTED_STOP_PCT. Butterfly (own 0.25), condor
        (CONDOR_STOP_LOSS_PCT) and continuation (0.15) never read this
        constant and are unchanged. (2) ORB_BLOCK_RANGING — ORB no longer
        fires under RANGING.
TCS_COOLDOWN_MIN retired to 0 (TC.6 no longer reads it);
        TCS_MIN_CREDIT_PCT_WIDTH superseded by the joint EV test.
TCS_LOSS_GIVEN_BREACH: the credit and POP floors are
        now ONE joint EV test rather than two independent ones.
TC.6 HOTFIX: TCS_START_ET (11:00), TCS_MIN_CREDIT_PCT_WIDTH
        (0.10), TCS_MIN_CREDIT_NICKEL_MULT (4.0), TCS_COOLDOWN_MIN (30). It
        rapid-fired the fleet selling $0.06 credits on $5 wides at 10:02 ET.
TREND_CREDIT_ACTIVE. TC.6 was the only new firing
        strategy with no env kill switch.
ENTRY_LIMIT_LADDER [0.50, 0.25, 0.00] @ 15s.
        DEFAULTS OFF (ENTRY_LADDER_ACTIVE=0) — the pricing primitive and the
        fill model land together, but nothing changes behaviour until the fill
        model is proven against live quotes.
PENNY_CLASSES + PRICE_INCREMENT_BOUNDARY. Option quote
        increments are class- AND level-dependent; `round(px, 2)` posts invalid
        limits on nickel/dime classes.
VERTICAL_HOLD_TO_ET (15:45). Credit verticals are exempt
        from the 15:40 flatten ladder; debit positions keep it, because the
        mark-limit phase is what stops every EOD exit paying the full spread.
CONDOR_RATCHET_STANDALONE_ONLY. The ratchet closed
        UNTESTED legs on a reversal; scoped to standalone only.
CONDOR_MAX_QUOTE_WIDTH (0.25 of mid). A ranking never
        refuses; a floor does.
CONDOR_MIN_POP / CONDOR_POP_BAR_MIN. Probability-of-profit
        floor on every short leg, defaulting to 0.70 — the BOTTOM of the
        operator's 70-80%% band, because he asked explicitly not to be
        restrictive on a trade he already knows is risky.
CONDOR PITCHFORK ANCHOR (PF.5). CONDOR_PITCHFORK_ANCHOR /
        CONDOR_REQUIRE_FORK / CONDOR_PF_TIMEFRAME / CONDOR_PF_FLAT_SLOPE.
        The pitchfork has been BUILT AND LIVE as a weight-0 observer since
        2026-08-12 with exactly ONE call site (main.py:2091, `_pf_snap`) and
        NOTHING has ever read the rails back. This is its first consumer — the
        one the white paper pre-registered, because strike placement produces a
        CREDIT that is directly comparable on identical tape.
        DAILY fork by operator ruling. A daily fork is invalidated only by DAILY
        closes, so an intraday session cannot kill it; the hourly one has a
        measured p50 lifetime of 5 bars plus a k=3 confirmation lag and would
        re-anchor mid-position. `CONDOR_PF_FLAT_SLOPE` exists because a SIGN is
        not a SLOPE — a fork drifting 0.001%% a bar is noise, and ordering legs
        off its sign would be reading a coin flip as structure.
CONTINUATION_STOP_LOSS_PCT default 0.25 -> 0.15. THE REPO
        DEFAULT IS THE FLEET LEVER, not the env var: every box receives
        config.py through git pull + bake, so this reaches all 15 on the bake
        already scheduled — no systemd edit, no rotate_tokens change (its FIELDS
        table is hardcoded to seven credentials and has no arbitrary-var path),
        no extra restart. `OT_CONT_STOP_PCT` remains the PER-BOX OVERRIDE, which
        is what a modular fleet wants. It is also the only path that
        participates in the version discipline — a systemd `Environment=` line
        is invisible to check_versions, absent from the changelog and outside
        git entirely.
        EVIDENCE: excursion_report floor sweep, `max_loss_floor /
        ContinuationStrategy`, n=66 across 9 sessions at a **0%% win rate** — a
        15%% floor stops all 66 with **ZERO WINNERS CUT**, NET DELTA +8.85 units
        of entry premium against +2.25 at the current 25%%. Meets the
        pre-registered cheapest-threshold-catching-zero-winners rule rather than
        an in-sample argmax.
        ⚠️ WHAT THIS COHORT IS, and why tightening it is not the same as
        tightening a thesis stop: these are BY DEFINITION the trades where NO
        insurance_stop. The thesis was still technically intact and the premium
        died anyway. Zero winners cut over 9 sessions is evidence it did not
        cost anything; it is not proof that it cannot.
DEBIT_DIRECTIONAL_CUTOFF_ET / _STRATEGIES / DEBIT_BLOCK_ACTIVE
        for main v6.2's afternoon debit block. Env: OT_DEBIT_CUTOFF_ET ("HH:MM")
        and OT_DEBIT_BLOCK_ACTIVE, so the hour moves and the rule dies without a
        deploy. ⚠️ ONE DEFINITION ONLY — a parallel AFTERNOON_NO_DEBIT_* block
        was drafted and removed before shipping; two names for one rule, with
        the later assignment silently winning, is the exact failure class the
        version discipline exists to catch.
SWP.2 + CNT.3, the two Tier-1 tuning priors.
        SWEEP_SETUP_FLOOR_SHORT (default 0.20) separates short sweeps from
        longs — three measures agree and the PLTR mechanism backs it, but n=6
        and a 0.20 floor against a ~0.265 score ceiling is a NEAR-DISABLE, not
        a dial. CONT_HANDOFF_BLOCK_COMPRESSION stops the runaway handoff firing
        under COMPRESSION (39 trades, 28% WR, and the worst never-favourable
        cell at 80%) — a runaway asserts expansion while the label asserts
        coiling.
CNT.2: CONT_INSURANCE_STOP (OT_CONT_INSURANCE, default on).
        Arms the already-stamped `underlying_stop` as a structural early
        invalidator for continuation, ONLY while BOSTracker.protected_level is
        None — i.e. only in the window BOS cannot cover — then hands off.
        Exits tag `insurance_stop`.
CNT.1: CONT_BREAKOUT_DIRECTION + CONT_BREAKOUT_MIN_ADX.
        Standalone continuation may now fire under BREAKOUT_VOLATILE, taking
        direction from the trend engine's `overall_direction` instead of from
        the label (which carries none). Gated on ADX rather than on
        floor is skipped and BREAKOUT's conviction is not the trend's. Tagged
        `trend_continuation_breakout` so it scores separately.
SWP.1: SWEEP_SETUP_FLOOR (OT_SWEEP_SETUP_FLOOR, default
        _sweep SETUP SCORE. The label wins 0.4% of live ticks and is exactly
        zero on 96%, so the trade was effectively off. A PRIOR for the
        collection phase, to be tightened on live fires.
15m FETCH DEPTH 50 -> 150, waking a vote that has never
        fired. trend_engine._analyze_single bails to NEUTRAL below EMA_SLOW+5=55
        bars, and 15m fetched 50 — so the 0.30 direction weight v3.1 moved ONTO
        15m on 07-16 (to route around starved 1d/1h) was itself dead on arrival.
        Only 5m (100 bars) has ever been able to vote.
        WHY 150 AND NOT 60: clearing 55 wakes the vote but not usefully. The
        engine re-seeds the EMA on whatever tail it is handed, so measured
        against a fully-warm EMA-50 the error is 69% of a 0.30 bar at 55 bars and
        49% at 60 — a confident vote on a number dominated by its seed, which is
        worse than an honest NEUTRAL. At 80 bars the error is 2.5%, at 150 it is
        0.3%. 150 15m bars is ~5.8 sessions.
        COSTS NOTHING IN DATA: candle_feed prunes to max(need,60)*PRUNE_FACTOR,
        so the store already retained 240 15m bars — only the fetch cap hid them.
        Raising need to 150 raises retention to 600 automatically.
        1h DELIBERATELY LEFT AT 50 (asleep). Operator's call: the market responds
        more to developments since the close than to the prior session's range,
        which is a reference point rather than a discriminator. A live 1h vote in
        the morning is dominated by the PRIOR session and would oppose the
        opening drive, suppressing TRENDING in exactly the 09:30-10:40 window
        under study. 15m carries more weight and has no such lag pathology.
        WATCH ON FIRST BAKE: TastyTrade's backfill reach is limited and the exact
        cutoff is unknown, so a cold store may not be served 150 immediately. It
        accumulates ~26 15m bars/session and the vote stays NEUTRAL until it
        fills — no worse than today. trend_engine v3.3's STARVED warning reports
        the real per-box depth from the first RTH session.
SWEEP STRIKE FLOOR. SWEEP_DELTA_STRONG 0.08 -> 0.12,
        paired unchanged with SWEEP_DELTA_WEAK 0.30. The inverse-delta
        scaling in strategy/sweep_reversal_strategy.py:_sweep_target_delta
        maps max conviction to the STRONG endpoint, so the highest-conviction
        sweeps were buying the FURTHEST-OTM contracts. On 2026-07-27 a 0.62
        conviction resolved to a 0.16 delta and bought a PLTR $122 put ~6%
        OTM, where gamma could not reach it inside the holding window. The
        endpoints now read: max conviction -> 0.12 delta (leveraged but
        REACHABLE), low conviction -> 0.30 (near-ATM), linear between.
        SEPARATE DEFECT, SEPARATE FIX: the same trade also had a bad ENTRY
        bundled — bundling them would make post-freeze sweep P&L
        unattributable between strike selection and entry quality.
PAPER FRICTION UNIFIED (audit defect T). Default
        PAPER_FILL_SLIPPAGE_PCT 0.01 -> 0.0, and the knob is now applied by
        ONE authority (execution/limit_ladder) across every paper path —
        single, butterfly, condor leg, and rolled vertical. Rationale: under
        the mark-limit policy (limit_ladder v1.2) live posts AT the mark and
        either fills there or does not fill, so a markup made paper
        PESSIMISTIC on price while still optimistic on fill rate. Booking the
        mark everywhere is the honest default; the residual paper->live gap is
        no-fill risk. The knob survives as a UNIFORM stress lever: set
        OT_PAPER_SLIPPAGE_PCT to the fill quality measured in the live
        shakedown and every paper path degrades together.
        Also folds in the un-bumped changes that shipped under the stale v3.3
        header (audit defect U): FLATTEN_WINDOW_OPEN_ET (15,40) 2026-07-22,
        CONDOR_TRIGGER_APPROACH 2026-07-17, runner-refinement knobs v2.0.
CUTOFF DISAMBIGUATION (defect H). Two constants named so
        similarly they were confused for one rule are now named for their scope,
        and the global cutoff is no longer hardcoded outside config.
        (a) NO_ENTRY_AFTER_ET -> ORB_NO_ENTRY_AFTER_ET. Unchanged at (11, 0).
            It is, and always was, the ORB-scoped cutoff (orb_engine v3.6) and
            the arm condition for sweep reversal (sweep_reversal_strategy v3.1).
        (b) NEW: GLOBAL_NO_ENTRY_ET = (14, 0) — the global 0DTE entry cutoff for
            ALL strategies. utils/time_utils v3.1 now READS this instead of
            hardcoding dtime(14, 0), so config is finally the single source of
            truth for both cutoffs.
        NOT a behaviour change: both cutoffs keep their exact prior values.
v1.0 — original release
remove Twilio, fix SWEEP_TARGET_DELTA to 0.08,
        remove Grade C, add BUTTERFLY_ENTRY_CUTOFF_ET
butterfly overhaul: fixed wings by instrument,
        GEX pin proximity gate (1x expected move), noon-2PM entry window,
        one-per-session limit, TP reduced to 20%
narrow SPX condor wings 25->5 so each vertical is
        affordable (max loss ~$235/contract), enabling half-budget-per-side
        condor sizing.
add DAILY_LOSS_LIMIT_USD (default = per-trade risk): halts
        new entries when the day's NET P&L is down by that amount.
add single-name instruments (NFLX/META/MU/MSFT/TSLA/AAPL/
        NVDA/SMCI/ORCL) as DIRECTIONAL-ONLY: ORB + sweep only, no condor/
        butterfly. Widens paper-trading coverage for data collection.
expand the tradeable universe to the full screener list.
live fill-confirmation knobs (LIVE_FILL_*, v3.5) and
        reconcile cadence (BROKER_RECONCILE_INTERVAL_MIN, v3.6); and
        BROKER_RECONCILE_ENABLED now defaults to the trading mode (LIVE=on,
        PAPER=off) so going live via configure.sh auto-enables reconciliation —
        explicit OT_BROKER_RECONCILE=True/False still overrides.
RUNNER REFINEMENTS (all env-tunable): MAX_LOSS_PCT
        25%→40% for directionals (butterfly pinned at 25% via
        BUTTERFLY_STOP_LOSS_PCT); USE_5M_FVG_TRAIL (5-minute FVGs anchor
        trails); FVG_FLOOR_MAX_LOCK_PCT=0.90 clamp; POST_TARGET_TRAIL_LOCK_PCT
        0.85→0.75 (leash no longer inverts past target);
        SWEEP_POST_TARGET_TRAIL=True (sweep runners trail past +100% instead
        of the hard TP).
LIVE_ENTRY_DEADLINE_SECONDS (entry fill-confirmation
        window, defect O) and PAPER_FILL_SLIPPAGE_PCT now env-tunable with an
        honest 1% default applied against the trade (defect R).
        Neutral strategies run ONLY on true-0DTE index products (SPY/QQQ/SPX/
        IWM); every other symbol (single names + weekly-only ETFs) is
        directional-only, derived automatically from FULL_STRATEGY_INSTRUMENTS.
sweep strike delta now scales with reversal strength
        (strong->far-OTM, weak->near-ATM); ORB strike snapping breaks toward
        higher/lower delta; paper fills at the exact bid/ask midpoint (no
        slippage) — all orders priced at the mark.
repo-wide v3.0 bump: Yahoo-Finance purge & data stream
        mapping optimization (all market data now flows from the single
        shared TastyTrade candle feed — see data/candle_feed.py). No logic
        change in this file.
TOLERANCES REMOVED + SESSION_LOSS_LIMIT deleted.
        (a) ORB_BREAK_BUFFER (0.05% of price) REMOVED. It gated the break on the
            close clearing the range by a PERCENTAGE — $0.49 on MU, ~$3.00 on SPX.
            The retest is already the noise filter (a meaningless break fails it),
            so the buffer only cost real setups while scaling into a hole on
            high-priced instruments. See orb_engine v3.5.
        (b) SESSION_LOSS_LIMIT (the integer 2) DELETED. It was a COUNT of losing
            trades from the v1.x count-based circuit breaker, and it is NOT the
            daily loss halt. It has been vestigial since risk_manager v1.4, which
            gates nothing. It survived only in dashboards, which printed
            "Session CB: 2 losses -> halt" for a halt that could never occur.
            The REAL halt is DAILY_LOSS_LIMIT_USD (below): dollars, net for the
            day, so a green day keeps trading no matter how many losses stack up.
DEAD-CONSTANT PURGE + honest comments.
        (a) BUTTERFLY_ENTRY_CUTOFF_ET 15:00 -> 14:00. The 15:00 value was
            UNREACHABLE: main.py calls session_guard.can_enter() WITHOUT
            is_butterfly=True, so the generic 14:00 cutoff always fired first.
            14:00 is also the intended rule (post-14:00 tape gets erratic on
            dealer hedging). This makes config agree with live behaviour; it is
            NOT a behaviour change.
        (b) REMOVED, never imported by any module (verified by grep across the
            tree and by git log -S back to the initial commit):
              ORB_TRAIL_ACTIVATION   — duplicate of TRAIL_ACTIVATION_PCT
              CONDOR_SHORT_DELTA     — from iron_condor v1.0 (delta selection),
              CONDOR_DELTA_TOLERANCE   dead since v1.1 made strikes BB-anchored
                                       a HARDCODED `aligned_timeframes < 2`; the
                                       config value (1) was LOOSER and unwired
              ENTRY_COOLDOWN_MINUTES — ORB's state machine IS the cooldown
                                       (waiting / armed / open are exclusive)
        (c) The Iron Condor comment claiming "Delta-based strike selection is
            primary" was false since v1.1 — strikes are Bollinger-Band anchored
            with NO delta anywhere. Corrected.
        (d) MIN_RRR and VWAP_FILTER_ACTIVE are RETAINED but explicitly marked
            UNWIRED. Both are genesis constants (present at the initial commit,
            never referenced, never mentioned in any changelog). They are kept
            because each names an intended feature that was never built — see
            the notes at their definitions. Deleting them would erase the only
            evidence the intent existed.
All secrets come from environment variables — never from hardcoded values
or editable files. The setup_ec2.sh script writes them into the systemd
unit so the bot has them at runtime without any manual file editing.
Tunable strategy parameters live here and are safe to commit.

# on requires the env var AND a v4 spec in TRADES.md — the flag is not the gap;
# the missing spec is.
# 🔴 DEFAULT IS ON. Operator has authorised TC.6 three separate times; the

# Observed 10:02 ET on 08-14: NVDA sold a $5-wide for $0.06, PLTR a $6-wide for
# $0.08, and every box re-entered seconds after a nickel close.
# THREE THINGS WERE MISSING AND EACH ONE ALONE WOULD HAVE STOPPED IT:
#  (1) NO AFTERNOON GATE. Designed as afternoon trend participation, coded
#      against GLOBAL_NO_ENTRY_ET (14:00). It fired at 10:02.
#  (2) NO MINIMUM CREDIT — and the POP floor CAUSES this. POP rises with
#      distance, so requiring POP >= 0.70 selects for FAR strikes, and far
#      strikes collect almost nothing. The probability half of the gate shipped
#      without the payoff half. A gate that only demands SAFETY systematically
#      finds the worst-paid trade that clears it.
#  (3) NO RE-ENTRY COOLDOWN. With credit $0.06 and the nickel close at $0.05,
#      total profit potential is ONE CENT — the trade closes on the tick it
#      opens, then reopens. "No per-session limit" was the operator's call and

# 🔴 r98 (2026-08-24) — 11:00 COLLIDED WITH THE RUNAWAY, WHICH FIRES ON THE
# SAME TRIGGER. The handoff credit spread and RunawayContinuation are two
# expressions of ONE event: an ORB that ran without retesting. AFD.1 blocks long
# debits from DEBIT_DIRECTIONAL_CUTOFF_ET = 11:30, so between 11:00 and 11:30
# BOTH were armed on the same runaway — and dispatch order decides, not design:
# RunawayContinuation gets first refusal (it must, because firing DISARMS the
# retest), sets `signal`, and TC.6 sits behind `if signal is None` and never
# runs. The handoff was therefore SHADOWED for the entire half hour it was
# nominally open, and only reachable after 11:30 by accident of the debit
# cutoff rather than by intent.
# ⚠️ 11:31, NOT 11:30. The cutoff test is `>= (11, 30)`, so the debit is already
# blocked AT 11:30; starting the credit at 11:30 would hand both strategies the
# same minute and reproduce the collision in miniature. One minute of daylight
# makes the handover unambiguous in the log and in the record.
# Operator, 2026-08-24: "Handoff (credit) needs to start at 1131 - it's

# all willy nilly like this."
# A flat credit floor and a flat POP floor are INDEPENDENT tests, and independent
# is the bug: POP >= 0.70 selects FAR strikes, far strikes pay little, and the
# two floors never talk to each other. The correct condition is a single
# inequality:
#       EV = credit * POP - L * width * (1 - POP) > 0
#   =>  credit / width  >  L * (1 - POP) / POP
# so a LOW-POP strike must pay RICHLY and a HIGH-POP strike may be thin. That is
# the shape a credit spread actually has.
# `L` is loss-given-breach as a fraction of width. **NOT 1.0**: a breach rarely
# runs the full width by the bell — TC.7's ORB-anchored cell measured E[loss]
# 0.35 on a $5 wide (7% of width) at 90% terminal-OK, and credit_edge put real
# credits at 8-19% of width. At L=1.0 a POP-0.70 strike would need 30% of width,
# which essentially never occurs, and the gate would silence TC.6 entirely —
# over-correcting into silence is its own failure.
# L=0.5 is a STATED PRIOR: it requires 21% of width at POP 0.70, 5.6% at POP
# 0.90, 2.6% at POP 0.95. Conservative against the measured 7%, and it produces

# Operator, 2026-08-25, reading CVX's card: "it's not 'risking' the correct
# amount. I don't account for max loss on every trade!!!"
# He is right, and the note above admits it in passing: "Sizing is FULL-PREMIUM
# based (risk unit = position size)". So RISK_PER_TRADE_USD has never been a
# risk budget — it is a POSITION-SIZE budget wearing a risk name, and the two
# diverge by exactly the stop.
# ⚠️ MEASURED ON TODAY'S OWN FIRES. Every ORB trade this morning was sized to
# deploy ~$1050 of premium while the -25% floor caps the actual loss near $260:
#   NVDA  $1206 deployed -> stop $4.52 ->  $302 at risk
#   TSLA  $1280 deployed -> stop $2.40 ->  $320 at risk
#   PLTR  $1400 deployed -> stop $3.50 ->  $350 at risk  (it lost $310)
# A $1050 budget was buying ~$300 of exposure. The CREDIT path never had this
# problem — compute_condor_leg_size divides by (width - credit), which is the
# true max loss because a credit spread genuinely CAN go to full width.
# ⚠️ WHY IT IS OPT-IN, DEFAULT OFF. The stop is SOFT — a premium threshold or a
# 1-min close, evaluated on a 15s tick, not a resting order with the venue. A
# gap or a halt can print through it, and on that path the full premium really
# is gone. Sizing to the stop assumes the stop holds. Turning this on roughly
# 4x's every debit position, which is correct by intent and still a large
# change to make silently: it also interacts with DAILY_LOSS_LIMIT_USD, since
# the same floored trade now costs the full budget rather than a quarter of it.

# justifies, and a stop 10% away mathematically licenses a 10x position. NVDA's
# own 2026-08-25 fire, sized on risk, wanted 10 contracts — $6,030 of premium
# to put $1,510 at risk, and the stop is SOFT, so a gap through it costs the
# $6,030 rather than the $1,510. That is 6x the intended risk on one trade.

# cost a 15-box session. This one is a dated instruction with a stated reason
# (the opening range is not established until 09:35, so nothing before it can
# be anchored to a range that does not yet exist). A future audit should be
# able to tell the two apart WITHOUT asking.
# ⚠️ IT GATES OPENINGS ONLY. Exits, rolls, inversions and the flatten are NEVER
# gated: a blocked exit is a stuck position, and a restart holding an adopted
# leg must be able to close it at 09:31.

#
# 420 = an RTH session (390 minutes) with margin, so the frame reaches 09:30

# instruction, 2026-08-24: **"DO NOT unsubscribe to ANYTHING. You can choose
# not to write it or not to display it, but we subscribe to EVERYTHING,
# period."** That is `docs/FEED_MANIFOLD.md`'s governing rule — capture
# everything the wire offers, give it a home, let consumers subscribe — and an
# unsubscribe is unrecoverable in a way a suppressed bulb is not: DXFeed
# history is same-evening only, so a stream nobody wanted today cannot be
# fetched back tomorrow. `candle_feed` still subscribes TimeAndSale on every
# symbol including indices. This constant is read ONLY by the health board.
#
# ⚠️ WHY THE BOARD NEEDS IT. Before this, SPX's manifold board painted
# `prints (T&S)` RED every session, forever, for a reason no operator action
# could ever clear. A board carrying a permanent red teaches the reader to skim
# past reds — precisely the failure the board was built to prevent
# (WORKING_AGREEMENT 17). A permanent red is worse than no bulb at all.
#
# ⚠️ THIS SET IS ABOUT THE TAPE ONLY. It says nothing about `Underlying` or
# `TheoPrice` on an index — those are option-chain events an index legitimately

#  It should only be in effect if there's one side open."  And:
# "don't close a leg if it hasn't been tested - that's what the roll is for."
# THE DEFECT IT FIXES: the base -25% stop only ever fires on the TESTED side
# (spread value rises as price approaches your short). But the ratchet tightens
# the UNTESTED side's stop to breakeven at +20% and +20% locked at +40% —
# precisely because it is WINNING. On the reversal the tested side stops at -25%
# AND the untested side hits its ratcheted stop, so a leg price never went near
# is closed by a stop that exists only because it was profitable. That is the
# double-stop: 5 of 14 condor symbol-days had BOTH sides stopped. It also fires
# BEFORE the roll can ever be used, because the roll needs a tested side.
# WHAT IS PRESERVED: `condor_stop` went 0% -> 19% win after the ratchet shipped,
# but that evidence came mostly from STANDALONES (18 of 46 legs never got a
# second side). Scoping to standalone keeps the gain where it was measured and
# removes it where it disassembles a working structure.
# ⚠️ ACCEPTED CONSEQUENCE: an untested leg that runs to +40% and reverses now
# gives it back rather than locking +20%. That is the price of not taking apart

# The flatten ladder opens at FLATTEN_WINDOW_OPEN (15:40) and posts mark-limits
# until the 15:45 cross, so a DEBIT position can close without paying the
# spread. That ladder is why it is not moved: opening it at 15:45 would leave
# zero time for the limit phase and force EVERY end-of-day exit marketable —
# the exact failure time_utils v3.8 was written to fix, and expensive on a book
# whose widest spread quintile already costs -$37/trade.
# BUT THE SIGN IS OPPOSITE FOR A CREDIT VERTICAL. A long debit sitting at 15:40
# is decaying to ZERO, so five more minutes cost the holder and the limit phase
# is pure upside. A SHORT vertical is decaying TOWARD the holder, and 15:40-15:45
# is the steepest part of that curve. Operator: "It's 5 more minutes of
# exponentially rising profit curve."
# ⚠️ NOT held past 15:45, deliberately. Every instrument here except SPX is
# AMERICAN-STYLE and PHYSICALLY SETTLED, so a spread finishing BETWEEN the
# strikes assigns the short and leaves an unhedged overnight stock position —
# "defined risk" is true at settlement, not through assignment. The paper engine
# has no assignment model and would never show it, which is the worst kind of
# clean result.
# ⚠️ COST, stated rather than hidden: verticals then close AT 15:45 with no
# limit phase of their own, so they pay the crossing. A few cents on a spread

# ── CNT.1 — continuation under BREAKOUT_VOLATILE (2026-08-07, operator's call) ─
# Standalone continuation was barred under BREAKOUT for a structural reason, not

# (TRENDING_BULL -> long, TRENDING_BEAR -> short) and BREAKOUT_VOLATILE asserts
# volatility EXPANSION without saying which way, so no branch could assign one.
# The runaway handoff already solves this by taking direction from the ORB.
# This does the same thing from the trend engine's own vote.
#
# WHY A SEPARATE ADX FLOOR RATHER THAN THE CONVICTION FLOOR: under a non-trending
# label `_label_trending` is False, so continuation's `CONTINUATION_CONV_FLOOR`
# check is SKIPPED ENTIRELY — the same hole the handoff path has. Reusing
# BREAKOUT's conviction, not the trend's. The direction is coming from the trend
# engine, so the quality bar must come from there too.
#
# DEFAULT = ADX_TREND_THRESHOLD (25), the same bar the rest of the system uses to
# call a trend a trend. A PRIOR, not a fit — deliberately permissive for the
# collection phase per the operator ("to gather data").
# Entries take setup_type `trend_continuation_breakout` so the rollup can score
# this path SEPARATELY from _standalone and _handoff. Without that split the
# data this is being turned on to collect would be unreadable.
# ── CNT.2 — the INSURANCE gate for continuation (2026-08-07, operator's call) ─
# BOS (exit_engine 2b) is continuation's thesis invalidator and it is
# deliberately UNGATED on P&L — but `BOSTracker.protected_level` starts None and
# is only set once the trade makes a new CLOSING HIGH past entry. So BOS is
# structurally BLIND until the trade goes favourable in the underlying, and that
# blind window is exactly where the 45 max_loss_floor trades die at −29% with
# MFE +1%.
#
# THE LEVEL IS ALREADY COMPUTED AND STORED, and until now was dead in the
# decision path: continuation_strategy:447/450 stamps
# `underlying_stop = gap.bottom - 0.5*atr` (long) / `gap.top + 0.5*atr` (short)
# on every entry, trade_logger:206 persists it, and the ONLY reader was
# query.py:233 — for display.
#
# WHY STRUCTURAL AND NOT A TIGHTER PREMIUM FLOOR: a premium-percent stop on 0DTE
# measures gamma, not thesis. The floor sweep proved a tighter one nets ~zero
# because it cuts winners that merely dip (peak is late, drawdown is early).
# This level is the ENTRY PREMISE INVERTED — continuation enters on a pullback
# INTO an unfilled 5m FVG expecting resumption, so price closing beyond the far
# edge plus a half-ATR buffer means the pullback was the reversal continuing.
#
# WHY IT DOES NOT REOPEN THE JULY DECISION: `underlying_stop` was rejected as
# THE exit for two reasons — "a gap fill is NOT trend failure" and "the FVG
# level is STATIC so it protects nothing once the trade works". Neither applies
# to a gate that lives ONLY while BOS has no protected level and yields the
# instant it does. It fills the hole that decision knowingly left; it does not
# overturn it.
#
# ⚠️ THE LEVEL HAS NEVER BEEN READ BY ANYTHING THAT TRADES, so it has no track

#                        structural (stop = impulsive origin, target = 100% of range
#                        width), so it varies per setup and is currently ungated.
#   VWAP_FILTER_ACTIVE — implies a HARD VWAP gate. None exists. What is live is a
#                        SOFT score in setup_scorer (vwap_alignment, weight 0.15;
#                        a misaligned trade scores 0.25 on that dimension and can
#                        still clear the 0.55 B-threshold). NOTE: crypto_trader
#                        learned the opposite lesson the hard way — shorts above
#                        VWAP / longs below VWAP had to become HARD blocks. That

# E + F (2026-07-31) — WIRED AT LAST. Both were declared here at genesis and
# never read by anything; `VWAP_FILTER_ACTIVE = True` in particular sat as a
# hardcoded True that nothing consulted, so "the filter is on" was true in the
# config and false in the code for months.
#
# Both now ship env-tunable and DEFAULT OFF, which is a deliberate downgrade from

#
# 🔴 EVERYTHING BELOW IS COMMENTED OUT AND NOTHING READS IT. Pruning on the
# boxes is OFF (candle_feed.PRUNE_KEEP_ROWS = 0) and stays off until this is
# deliberately enabled. Declaring it inert is the point: the numbers can be
# argued with before a single row is at risk.
#
# 🔑 THE BINDING CONSUMER IS EMA_ANCHOR = 200, and it inverts the intuition.
# Every tenor needs the SAME NUMBER OF BARS, so the DAYS differ by how fast that
# tenor accumulates them:
#
#     tenor   bars/session   200 bars =      keep      why
#     1m           390       0.5 sessions    5 days    days are for RE-PUSH,
#                                                      not warm-up
#     5m            78       2.6 sessions   10 days
#     15m           26       7.7 sessions   20 days
#     1h             7      28.6 sessions   60 days    ← THE BINDING ONE
#     1d             1     200   sessions   keep all   one row a day
#
# ⚠️ A FLAT ROW CAP IS WRONG, AND THAT IS WHAT EXISTS TODAY. PRUNE_KEEP_ROWS is
# one number for every tenor: at 200 it would hold half a session of 1m and 29
# sessions of 1h. A naive "keep 30 days of everything" fails the other way — it
# wastes space on the bulkiest tenor while STARVING THE 1h FORK, which is the
# condor's anchor and the thing already failing to build.
#
# ⚠️ THE FORK ITSELF NEEDS FAR LESS THAN THE EMA: (2k+1)*3 bars, k=3 on 1h = 21
# bars = 3 sessions. If EMA_ANCHOR is ever confirmed NOT to be consumed on 1h,
# the 60 days below drops to about 5.

# resumption, so the level lands inside the symbol's own noise band and the next
# ordinary wiggle fires it. Observed live 2026-08-10: JPM in $1.26 12:49, out
# $0.00 12:50, back in $1.26 the same minute — the exit condition was already
# true at entry. QQQ fragmented one move into four scratches the same session.
# Expressed in ATR so it scales with the symbol; a raw price gap could not.
# 0.0 restores the pre-v4.15 behaviour exactly (kill switch and A/B control).
BOS_MIN_DIST_ATR = float(os.getenv("OT_BOS_MIN_DIST_ATR", "0.35"))

# A trend continuation is, definitionally, a trend resuming after a pullback.
# RANGING and COMPRESSION are the assertion that there is NO trend to continue,
# so a continuation entry there is not a marginal call — it is a contradiction.
# It happened anyway because the dispatch gate reads
# and `_is_runaway` BYPASSES THE LABEL ENTIRELY. So an ORB runaway flag let
# continuation fire on any tape at Priority 2 — ahead of Butterfly (P3, needs
# RANGING/COMPRESSION) and Condor (P4, needs RANGING), both of which sit behind
# `if signal is None` and were therefore never evaluated.
# MEASURED over 13 sessions: RANGING → Continuation 94 trades vs IronCondor 27;
# COMPRESSION → Continuation 39 vs Butterfly 6. Continuation took 3.5x the
# strategies exist for.
# CNT.3 already blocked the handoff in COMPRESSION, but only INSIDE the strategy
# and only for the handoff path — RANGING was never covered, and a strategy-level
# check cannot stop the slot being consumed before P3/P4 are reached.
# Set to 0 to restore the pre-CNT.6 behaviour exactly (kill switch and A/B).
# that branch was unreachable. OT_CONT_BLOCK_PREMIUM is now INERT.

# ── CONTINUATION CONFIRMATION TOLERANCE (v1.6, 2026-08-11) ───────────────────
# v1.5 required the confirmation bar to close STRICTLY beyond the tagging bar's
# extreme. Measured on the first live session, that failed BY PENNIES:
#   QQQ  need < 720.26  got 720.34   (8c, 0.011%)
#   PLTR need < 175.18  got 175.22   (4c, 0.023%)
#   CVX  need > 194.94  got 194.91   (3c)
#   TSLA need > 334.39  got 334.35   (4c)
#   SPX  need < 7735.58 got 7737.13  (1.55, 0.02%)
# Those are TIES, not failed resumptions — the bar closed essentially AT the
# extreme and was rejected on a rounding-level margin. The thesis is right; the
# comparison was too literal.
# Expressed in ATR so it scales with the symbol: an 8c miss is nothing on QQQ
# and everything on GLD, and a fixed cent value could never serve both.
# 0.40 IS DERIVED FROM THE SESSION, NOT PREFERRED. Expressing every logged miss
# in ATR units produces a CLEAN GAP with nothing in it:
#   near-misses (ties):  0.073 · 0.229 · 0.300 · 0.318 · 0.333 · 0.344 · 0.360
#   genuine failures:    1.133 · 1.442 · 1.694 · 1.743 · 3.355
# The two populations separate at better than 3x, so any value between 0.36 and
# 1.13 splits them and 0.40 sits just past the near-miss tail with a wide margin
# before the nearest real failure. My first draft used 0.05 and would have
# rejected EVERY case above — a no-op wearing the name of a fix, caught only by
# testing the constant against the actual logged misses instead of shipping it.
# ⚠️ ONE SESSION. The gap is wide and the classes are unambiguous, but this is
# a single day's evidence — re-derive it once a week of post-deploy misses
# exists rather than treating 0.40 as settled.
# 0.0 restores the strict v1.5 comparison exactly (kill switch and A/B control).

# ── SWP.4 (2026-08-11) — RECOVERY MEASURED FROM THE SWEPT LEVEL ──────────────
# The entry-distance gate measured recovery from `sweep.sweep_price` (the wick
# extreme of the raid), so a DEEPER rejection made the entry look FARTHER away
# and the gate refused the best setups. On a fabricated textbook PDL raid a
# 2.36% rejection produced a 2.4% "recovery" against the 2.0% cap and was
# rejected outright. Measured from the POOL (the level reclaimed — the thesis
# actually being traded) the same setup reads 0.11%.
# Wick depth is rejection QUALITY and `rejq_val` already scores it; it has no
# business inflating a distance-from-entry measure.

# **32.9% still had a LIVE thesis** — price had never accepted back through the
# raided level and was still on the correct side. ~9.5 valid setups discarded
# per symbol-day, on a clock.
# The right test already exists in spirit: `veto_accept` asks whether price
# accepted beyond the level — it is just a BIRTH-TIME snapshot. LIQ.3 makes it
# a running check, and this gate reads it.
# ⚠️ THE BACKSTOP IS DELIBERATE. A level that still holds at 5 hours is a
# different trade from a fresh raid, and this is a collection phase. 48 bars
# (5m-equivalent) = 4 hours: generous enough to keep the 32.9%, bounded enough
# that "still holding" cannot mean "all week".

# ── VEL.1 (2026-08-12) — VELOCITY STALL: "is this thing MOVING at all?" ──────
# The third question, and until now nobody asked it. `orb_structure_stop` asks
# "did the thesis break?"; `_theta_bleed` asks "is my GAIN about to evaporate?"
# (gate 1 is a gain floor, so it never looks at a losing position). A LOSING
# POSITION THAT HAS STOPPED MOVING answers NO to both and falls to the -40%
# percentage floor, which is the ABSENCE of a mechanism rather than one.
#
# THE STATISTIC, and note it needs NO TARGET — which is why it generalises to
# every long-premium strategy, not just ORB:
#     breakeven velocity  bev = |theta| / (|delta| * 1440)     underlying pts/min
#                               at which delta gains exactly offset decay.
#     delivered velocity        cumulative underlying travel toward the trade's
#                               direction, per minute since entry.
#     ratio = delivered / bev.  1.0 is the FLAT LINE. Below it the position
#                               bleeds even while the thesis is intact.
