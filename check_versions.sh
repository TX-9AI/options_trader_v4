# v4.0  2026-08-19  Ported from options_trader_v3 at the OTV4 split.
#
# INHERITED DOCTRINE
# MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
# Dated release framing and trivia are stripped; what remains is the
# reasoning behind the thresholds, the design guarantees, and the
# defects that recur when forgotten. WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires
# this block be read before the file is edited.

# TCS.3 (main v6.12): the trend-participation bound now
#         reads TODAY'S 09:30 5m bar — the 1m-only version lost its source
#         bars at ~10:35 ET, 25 min before the credit window opened, so TC.6
#         could never fire (fleet-verified before fixing). Canary greps the
#         5m-primary branch, never a version string.
# AUDIT A2 (mapper v4.1, ledger v1.1, main v6.11,
#         position_manager v3.3): behavior canaries for the audit-2 fix set —
#         section truncation guard + DST-derived NY hours, the deep named
#         frame wired into analyze, the gap-safe ledger feed + restart
#         hydrate, the orphan announcement in the MANAGE branch (the only
#         branch that runs with a leg open), and an ABSENCE canary on the
#         dead session-pool knob (assignment pattern, so changelog mentions
#         of the bare name stay legal — the SWP.1 lesson).
# AUDIT F1/F2/F4/F6 (exit_engine v4.21, main v6.9,
#         position_manager v3.2). Five canaries, every one guarding a defect
#         that was REPRODUCED AT RUNTIME while 162 text-based tests stayed
#         green: the structure IMPORT (without it, NameError on every condor
#         tick and a ~7.5-min crash loop), the DISPATCH routing credit
#         verticals by structure (without it, every new TC.6 record is managed
#         by the DEBIT sweep evaluator with sign-inverted P&L), the F4 seed
#         guard 0<persisted<base_stop (without the bound the restart seed
#         would adopt stale/foreign trail values as a ratchet), the TC.6
#         is_condor_leg=0 conditional (without it TC.6 rows spoof
#         _condor_sibling_open and condor_roll), and position_manager pricing
#         by structure (without it, main v6.9 makes TC.6 premium fetch fall to
#         the single-leg path — the paired-commit hop).
#         ⚠️ TITLE DRIFT FIXED: this file's title read v4.46 while its newest
#         changelog entry was v4.51 — five bumps recorded below the line that
#         claims the version. Same failure class as the devtools banner.
# LIQ.1 + SWP.4. Three canaries, all guarding SILENT
#         failures: the dedupe tiebreak (losing it empties swept_named_level
#         and the SWEEP score becomes exactly 0.000, with no error anywhere),
#         the session-pool gate (London overlaps RTH by 2.5h, so its level is
#         set by the price being traded), and the recovery anchor (from the
#         wick, a deeper rejection reads as a farther entry).
# OBSERVER DEBT. Two canaries pin the EVALUATION DATE into
#         the code itself: a backlog entry can be skimmed, a module docstring is
#         read by whoever next touches the file. Zero firings by 08-14 means
#         DELETE, not "leave it running".
# VEL.1 velocity stall. The load-bearing canary is the
#         BREACH COUNTER in __init__: without it the check AttributeErrors on
#         first call, the except swallows it, and the whole mechanism is a
#         permanent SILENT no-op that still looks shipped. Also pins the ladder
#         ORDER (theta_bleed before velocity) and current_delta being stashed.
# PF.2 containment anchor + weight-0 observer. The
#         load-bearing canary is the §4.4 CONFIRMATION LAG guard: without it the
#         builder returns forks anchored on information that did not exist when
#         P2 printed, nothing errors, and every backtest result from them is
#         fiction. Also pins the 1d frame depth — the boxes hold 84 daily bars
#         and the engines were being handed 10.
# RGM.6. The load-bearing canary is the L1-argmax rung
#         itself: without it the fallback silently reverts to v13 and UNKNOWN
#         climbs back to ~18% with nothing erroring. Also pins the four-state
#         engine tag, because [v13] has been the fallback-rate measure and a
#         collapse back to two states makes that number mean something else.
# LIQ.1 + LIQ.3 + SWP.4 + SWP.5. Six canaries, every one
#         guarding a SILENT failure: the dedupe tiebreak (losing it empties
#         swept_named_level and the SWEEP score is exactly 0.000, no error), the
#         session-pool gate (London overlaps RTH by 2.5h so its level is set by
#         the price being traded), the recovery anchor (from the wick, a deeper
#         rejection reads as a farther entry), and the running liveness check
#         plus its bounded backstop (without them the gate reverts to a clock
#         that discarded 32.9% of still-live theses).
# CNT.7 confirmation tolerance. The canary pins the ATR
#         form, because the failure mode is a SILENT NO-OP: a tolerance too
#         small to admit any real tie leaves the gate exactly as strict while
#         looking fixed. My first draft was 0.05 and did precisely that.
# BFLY.1 butterfly readiness rewritten around the pin.
#         The load-bearing canary is the ABSENCE of `coil` from hard_vetoes.
#         `_combine` treats hard_vetoes as a ZERO TEST, so restoring it there
#         changes NOTHING on a COMPRESSION or RANGING tick and only bites where
#         coil_val is exactly 0 — which is why the first version of the test
#         could not fail. Pin the corroborator form instead.
# CV.1 CLOSED. The orphaned condor_plan_lifetime canary is
#         removed with its reasoning inline, and this file reports ALL GREEN on
#         a clean checkout for the first time in weeks. That matters more than
#         the one check: a permanently-red sweep trains the reader to skip its
#         own DONE banner, at which point every OTHER canary here stops working
#         too. Also adds the VW.1f pins.
# RGM.4 per-regime commit bar. Two canaries: the override
#         map itself, and the ARMING site using the challenger's own bar. If
#         either reverts to the global theta_commit, RANGING goes quiet again
#         with no error — it reads as "no ranges today", which is exactly how it
#         hid for weeks.
# CNT.6 continuation blocked in the premium regimes. The
#         canary pins the NEGATED form (`not _cont_blocked`) because restoring
#         the bare `_is_runaway or ...` bypass raises NOTHING — butterfly and
#         condor simply go quiet again, which reads as "no setups today" rather
#         than as a regression. That is the failure this file exists for.
# sweep readiness approach (trade_readiness v1.7). The
#         load-bearing canary is the ABSENCE of a label hard-veto: `is_sweep`
#         back in hard_vetoes returns the whole track to a permanent zero and
#         NOTHING ELSE BREAKS — no error, no log, exactly how it sat dead for
#         two days. Also pins the shadow-FITTED ramp bounds, because 0.15/1.20
#         put the median tick at zero and the factor was dead on 3/4 of the
#         session.
# BOS minimum distance (exit_engine v4.15). Two canaries
#         carry the weight: the RATCHET (max/min), because low-min_dist is not
#         monotone and losing it slackens the stop as volatility widens; and the
#         min_dist==0 branch, because if that stops being byte-identical the
#         kill switch silently stops being one.
# continuation 1-bar confirmation (v1.5). Pins the gate,
#         the knob, and — the one that matters — the REFUSAL on an undecidable
#         confirmation. Falling through on thin tape would restore the
#         unconfirmed entry invisibly and only sometimes, which is the worst
#         shape a regression can take here.
# sweep spent-move (regime_confluence v1.4) + L1 evidence
#         on the fired disposition (main v5.9). The LOAD-BEARING canary is
#         `soft_necessary=.trend_opp, age_decay.` — if trend_opp ever leaves
#         that list a high ambient score can rescue a sweep fighting an
#         accelerating opposing trend, and the 2026-07-27 PLTR loss re-opens.
#         Also pins the deliberate absence ASYMMETRY: "" must NOT suppress
#         (opp_mom 0.6) and must NOT corroborate (exh_val 0.0). Making those
#         symmetric in EITHER direction is a regression, so both are pinned.
#         NOTE the bracket form is escaped — grep reads [..] as a character
#         class, which silently matched a single char on the first attempt.
# `dir` on every readiness track (trade_readiness v1.6).
#         Four canaries, and the load-bearing one is the CONDOR EXPOSURE
#         mapping: a call credit is SHORT, which is the inverse of the intuitive
#         call=long reading. Inverting it would flip every condor row in the
#         orientation ledger while the output still rendered perfectly — the
#         wrong-answer-that-looks-right class this file exists to catch. Also
#         pins sweep's dir to the LIVE liq_map source (unrecoverable offline)
#         and butterfly's explicit "neutral", so sideless-by-design can never
#         again be mistaken for a field that was never written.
# VWAP reaches the journal. volatility_engine has computed
#         vwap/price_vs_vwap all along and nothing persisted them — a key scan of
#         11,138 records found no VWAP field anywhere, which is why
#         vwap_orientation has never run. The canary pins the EMIT, not just the
#         helper: a value computed, available and never written is exactly the
#         failure being fixed.
# readiness_digest v1.2: the headline pegged count and the
#         FIT SUGGESTIONS list now measure the SAME thing (ramped output). They
#         disagreed, and the headline is what people act on.
# A2 becomes a BANDED METRIC. It had failed every session
#         since the harness existed (16 diary sessions, all 4/5) because the
#         invariant was wrong, not the engine: TRENDING reads ~70min and RANGING
#         ~25min, so both scoring high is a real state. A permanently-failing
#         check hides a NEW failure — the canary pins the band so nobody quietly
#         reverts it to `both == 0`.
# conditional_tables v1.6 DE-DUPLICATES. The box DBs are
#         cumulative and the harvest copies them into every dated folder, so the
#         same trade was counted once per subsequent day. trade_id was not even
#         SELECTed. Inflated n makes Wilson intervals too NARROW — cells look
#         decisive when they are not.
# conditional_tables v1.5: the trade-DB glob had NEVER
#         matched a file, and an empty load printed a statistical verdict. Both
#         canaries are absence-shaped in spirit — the failure mode is a tool that
#         runs clean, exits 0 and reports a null on a corpus it never read.
# conditional_tables v1.4 reports SESSION SPREAD. The 08-05
#         headline named a starve candidate at n=48 with an interval excluding
#         50%, and the tool could not say whether that was eight sessions or two
#         bad days. The canary pins the DATE REACHING Cell.add, not just the
#         flag: dropping it leaves every cell claiming to be a standing pattern
#         and raises nothing.
# W.2b: the three TIER-1 handlers the 2026-08-05 census
#         flagged now log inline. All three shipped the previous evening, hours
#         after the W.2a lesson was written down — the census caught them in one
#         cycle, which is the system working. Canaries pin the log calls, not
#         the handlers: the swallow is correct in all three cases, the SILENCE
#         was not.
# N.9 contract telemetry. Canaries pin the OCC-symbol match
#         and BOTH fill seams: matching on strike would attribute one condor
#         leg's greeks to the other, and a condor leg that skipped the capture
#         would be invisible in the decomposition while still appearing in P&L.
#         Neither failure raises anything.
# +2 canaries for the condor plan-lifetime audit and the
#         corrected DIRECTIONAL_ONLY comment. The stale comment claimed single
#         names were skipped; the config has enabled every box since 07-14, and
#         reading the comment instead of the value cost an investigation.
# candle_feed v3.11 collapses both RTH checks into ONE
#         predicate, and pull_today_ohlc v1.5 restores its guard to ON now that
#         the real cause (v3.10) is fixed. The canary counts CALLS to the
#         predicate rather than matching a condition: three independent clock
#         checks in a chain is what caused the outage, and a fourth written by
#         hand is what this prevents.
# candle_feed v3.10: `--once` exempt from BOTH RTH gates.
#         THE ABSENCE CANARY IS THE POINT — a bare `if not is_rth():` inside
#         run() is the v3.9 form, and it hangs every EOD candle retrieval with
#         no exception, no non-zero exit and an INFO line. It cost two sessions
#         of sat-out tape, and DXFeed history is same-evening only.
# pull_today_ohlc v1.4: the RTH guard is OFF BY DEFAULT per
#         operator directive, gated on OT_PULL_RTH_GUARD. The canary now pins
#         the KNOB rather than the condition — the refusal path still exists and
#         must stay correct for when it is switched back on.
# pull_today_ohlc v1.3: the RTH guard now requires a LIVE
#         OPTIONSBOT, not just the clock. +2 canaries, one of them an ABSENCE
#         check on the v1.1 condition — the old form silently wrote header-only
#         csvs for every sat-out box backfill woke, and DXFeed history is
#         same-evening only, so a revert costs a session of tape per night with
#         no error anywhere.
# +3 canaries: a2_cooccurrence v1.2's parse-time slim (the
#         OOM that SIGKILLed devtools 47 with no traceback and no output) and
#         the audit v1.5 ACCEL-per-held-bar denominator. The slim canary pins
#         _KEEP by name because a future analysis reading a dropped field does
#         not crash — it reads None, and the tool prints a clean table
#         describing nothing.
# main v5.4: ORB EXEMPT FROM THE STALE ENTRY GATE, +3
#         canaries and the header re-pinned. v5.0's block sat ABOVE the dispatch
#         so ORB_FIRES_REGARDLESS_OF_REGIME was unreachable on a stale tick, and
#         the fleet lost 09:35-09:41 of the flagship's window every session since
#         it deployed. The ABSENCE canary is the load-bearing one: the v5.0
#         unconditional form returns before ORB is ever consulted, raises
#         nothing, and shows up only as fewer morning trades.
# +2 canaries for pitchfork_filter_audit v1.4's variant
#         sweep. The load-bearing one pins that `variant` is THREADED to the
#         replay: swallow it and the sweep still prints a clean three-row table,
#         three runs of one variant wearing three labels. A comparison that
#         silently compares nothing is worse than no comparison.
# tcs_floor_durability v1.3: +2 canaries on the MATCHED
#         CONTROL. Every rate this tool printed before v1.3 was an absolute with
#         nothing to beat — in a trending tape a recent extreme survives
#         terminally most of the time regardless. Losing the control does not
#         error; it restores a number that looks like a result and is a fact
#         about the tape. The DRAW is pinned separately from the flag, because a
#         fixed anchor satisfies determinism while measuring nothing.
# tcs_floor_durability v1.2: +2 canaries on the TERMINAL
#         split. v1.1 measured INTRADAY violation, which is not what a
#         defined-risk 0DTE spread loses on — it expires on the close. Collapsing
#         terminal back onto intraday would restore an 82% "failure" rate for
#         trades that would have expired fine, so the terminal test and the
#         strike curve are both pinned by name.
# tcs_floor_durability v1.1: +2 canaries on the POPULATION
#         FILTER. v1.0's first real run measured every floor the rolling
#         lookback ever computed instead of the ARMED ones the strategy would
#         have traded — 5,129 "impulses" that were mostly arithmetic. It did not
#         error and it did not look wrong; it answered a question nobody asked.
#         The default is pinned to ARMED and the DORMANT-exclusion is pinned by
#         name, because reverting either restores a confidently wrong number.
# +2 canaries for tcs_floor_durability v1.0 (TC.4b's
#         prerequisite). The DEDUP one is load-bearing: the readiness track
#         scores every tick, so one impulse appears on hundreds of consecutive
#         journal rows. Losing the dedup key does not error — it reports a
#         sample size that does not exist and weights a long-lived impulse
#         hundreds of times, which is a confidently wrong answer rather than a
#         missing one.
# +3 canaries for gap_outcome_join v1.5 (--pool gapflat).
#         The pooled cell and its legitimacy verdict are ONE feature: pooling
#         two arms that disagree manufactures a null from two real opposite
#         effects, and the pooled table cannot show it. A sync that kept the
#         flag and dropped the verdict would be worse than one that dropped
#         both, so the verdict is pinned by name.
# labels are BULL/BEAR and the map is SHARED. The same
#         truncation defect was found in tests/replay_confluence.py (the
#         nightly emitted-distribution line the freeze watch reads) and in
#         regime_confluence's self-test. Canaries now pin the shared map and
#         each consumer of it, because fixing one renderer leaves the next free
#         to invent its own abbreviation.
# +3 canaries for regime_diary v1.3. The ABSENCE check is
#         the load-bearing one: `k.split('_')[0][:4]` collapsed TRENDING_BULL
#         and TRENDING_BEAR into the same token for 16 sessions and nothing
#         failed — no error, no test, a report that simply could not express
#         the distinction. A revert would be equally silent.
# main header pin v5.2 -> v5.3, and +3 W.2a canaries. The
#         pin FAILED on its own during the W.2a pass, which is the point of
#         having it: a version bump that nobody re-pins is how the pin sat at
#         v4.8 while the fleet ran v5.0.
# +3 canaries for main v5.2 (no regime-flip exit on a
#         stale book). The ABSENCE check is the one that matters: the gate is a
#         single argument, so a stale sync reverting it produces NO error and NO
#         log line — exits simply start firing on unconfirmed labels again, and
#         the only visible symptom would be regime_flip hold-times creeping back
#         down weeks later in flicker_audit. Also pins the main header to v5.2.
# +6 canaries for N.5 exit-ladder latency (exit_engine
#         v4.11 / trade_logger v3.11). The load-bearing one is the ABSENCE
#         check on the confirmed-guard: writing telemetry on an UNCONFIRMED
#         pass books the fast final leg of every slow close, which is the exact
#         population the TC.2 stop-trigger decision is measured on — a silent
#         corruption of the answer rather than a missing column. Found by
#         running the deliberate-failure check, not by reading the code.
# +7 canaries for the ENTRY SNAPSHOT (main v5.1 /
#         trade_logger v3.10 / analysis/entry_snapshot.py v1.0), and the stale
#         main-header pin corrected: it still read v4.8 while the fleet ran
#         v5.0, so the one check whose whole job is "is main current" had been
#         green on a two-version drift. Now pinned to v5.1.
#         The load-bearing canary is the ABSENCE one on the condor call sites.
#         The capture is log-only, so if a stale sync drops the ctx argument the
#         condor legs simply stop being captured — no error, no alert, and the
#         column keeps filling from the directional path, which is exactly what
#         a working capture looks like. Nothing else in the repo can see that.
# +4 canaries for main v4.8: the opening warm-up now logs
#         INFO rather than a WARNING that fired on 13/15 boxes every morning for
#         designed behaviour, and regime_log/trades carry the engine that
#         produced each label. The engine stamp is the one that matters most —
#         without it, "which engine labelled this row" was answerable only by
#         grepping bot.log, and the designed v1.3 opening window could not be
#         excluded from an L2-conditioned fit.
# REACHABILITY CANARY. main v4.7 fixed the real 07-29 root
#         cause: `_REGIME_ENGINE` is .lower()ed to "l2" while both gates compared
#         it to "L2", so L2.5 never executed once on any box since v4.0 wired it.
#         An absence canary now fails if the uppercase literal returns, plus a
#         presence check on the startup engine-identity line. This is the canary
#         that would have caught it: no test, no log line and no alert could,
#         because a gate that never opens raises nothing.
# +2 canaries for main v4.6's audible L2 gate, and the
#         version-pinned main header moved to v4.6. The gate matters because a
#         probe showed L2 CAN commit (tick 1, conviction 0.984) while production
#         may still print [v13] indefinitely from starved evidence — with no log
#         line at all before v4.6.
# L2.5 IMPORT-CONTRACT CANARIES + absence-loop counting.
#         Adds 3 presence checks and 1 absence check pinning main.py v4.5's
#         corrected L2 import and the v1.7 degraded-engine pager, after an
#         ImportError swallowed by the L2 guard put all 15 boxes on the v1.3
#         classifier for a full session. Also fixes a defect in v4.3's own
#         banner: the regime_confluence ABSENCE loop printed ✗ STALE without
#         incrementing MISS, so a restored fabricated fallback would have
#         reported "ALL CANARIES GREEN". Absence failures now count.
# GLYPH FIX (legibility, no logic change). Every status
#         line printed a literal "\u2713 PRESENT" / "\u2717 MISSING": bash's
#         echo does not interpret \u escapes, so the check/cross glyphs have
#         never actually rendered — inherited defect, present since the marks
#         were introduced, caught on the first control-side run of v4.3. Now
#         literal UTF-8 characters. Matters most for the v4.3 banner: 15 boxes
#         of output are meant to be scanned, and a wall of \u2717 defeats that.
#         Grep note: `grep '✗'` now works; `grep MISSING` always did and is
#         still the encoding-proof form for fleet passes.
# PARITY INVARIANT (closes the last open piece of audit
#         defect U). New section after GIT STATE: compares this checkout's
#         HEAD to origin HEAD via ls-remote — RED on mismatch (a box running
#         stale code passes every fingerprint if its files are internally
#         consistent; only the commit comparison catches "consistent but
#         old"). Origin unreachable = WARN not FAIL (boxes may check while
#         offline); dirty tracked files = WARN (fingerprints on a modified
#         file prove nothing about origin). Also: MISSING/PARITY failures now
#         counted and summarized on the DONE banner, so option-23 fleet output
#         is one greppable line per box instead of 125. Exit code deliberately
#         still 0 — callers' semantics unchanged.
# +5 canaries: trade_readiness v1.2 (all factor bounds
#         OT_TR_* overridable — parity with OT_RC_*) and readiness_digest v1.1
#         (factor calibration + fit suggestions).
# +3 canaries: trade_readiness v1.1 staged picks, main
#         v4.4, tests/readiness_digest.py (conductor phase-9 target).
# +6 canaries: trade_readiness v1.0 engine + main v4.3
#         every-tick hook (LOG-ONLY readiness workstream).
# +1 canary: regime_confluence v1.3.1 compression
#         containment veto (the A3 squeeze-break fix the A/B pool surfaced).
# CONFLUENCE EXCAVATION CANARIES. Adds 11 presence checks
#         and 4 ABSENCE checks for regime_confluence v1.3, plus 2 VALUE-pinned
#         checks for the config v4.0 sweep strike floor. The absence loop is the
#         load-bearing half: v1.3 was mostly about REMOVING terms (two constant
#         corroborators, two fabricated no-window fallbacks), and a stale sync
#         that restores them keeps every constant NAME intact while silently
#         reverting the behaviour. The v1.3 changelog was deliberately written
#         WITHOUT naming those four identifiers so these bare-token greps stay
#         honest — the changelog-prose trap has re-tripped absence canaries twice
#         (_orb_quality, then again during this pass before it shipped).
# HEADER-AUDIT LABEL CORRECTIONS (no canary logic change):
#         risk_manager's 2026-07-23 full-budget entry relabeled v1.4 -> v3.2
#         (the file was already at v3.1); butterfly's 2026-07-14 discount gate
#         v1.4 -> v3.2; status.py's duplicated v1.12 (2026-07-20) -> v1.13.
#         Prose references below updated to match. Fingerprints unchanged.
#         BONUS CATCH: the half_budget absence canary was legitimately RED —
#         risk_manager's success-path log still referenced the deleted
#         half_budget variable (NameError on every successful condor-leg
#         sizing). Fixed as risk_manager v3.3; canary now green.
# chain-archival fingerprints. A stale sync silently stops
#         archiving option chains, and chains cannot be backfilled — every
#         un-archived session is a permanent hole in the dataset.
# condor v2 fingerprints (exit_engine v4.1, risk v3.2,
#         iron_condor v3.2, 11:11 gate). A stale sync silently restores the
#         un-ratcheted stop (every stopped leg round-tripped from ~+25% to
#         -25%), the half-size verticals, the leg-2 CANCEL, or the 11:00 window
#         that runs on a bb_middle=current_price fallback.
# continuation EXIT-rework fingerprints (exit_engine v4.0):
#         5m-anchored trail, theta-bleed enabled, 25%% backstop. A stale file
#         silently reverts to 1m tripwire trails and NO theta protection.
# continuation-unblock fingerprints (defect W). Pins that
#         TrendState surfaces primary_momentum and that the strategy READS it
#         — a stale sync of either file silently re-blocks the trade forever
#         with no error and no log, which is exactly how it hid for 4 days.
#         Also an ABSENCE check on the phantom "STEADY" value.
# ORB geometry-gate fingerprints (setup_scorer v1.4).
#         Pins that the ORB grades via _grade_orb (liquidity-in-path A/B only)
#         and that _orb_quality is GONE — a stale file would silently restore
#         the regime/VWAP/macro-weighted ORB score that could veto a confirmed
#         break. Absence-check on _orb_quality is inverted (see below).
# CANARY GAP CLOSED (audit defect U). Before this the
#         newest fingerprint was dated 2026-07-18: a stale sync of ANY file
#         shipped 07-20 → 07-22 (orb v3.9, sweep v3.2, main v4.0/v4.1,
#         regime_confluence v1.2, the whole limit_ladder execution change,
#         status v1.13) passed this check silently — the exact failure mode
#         this script exists to catch, and the one that caused the 07-16
#         unmanaged-position incident. Adds 16 fingerprints covering every
#         post-07-18 change, and pins the two VALUES (not just the names)
#         that a stale file would revert: the de-saturated ramp bound and the
#         paper-friction default.
# repo-wide v3.0 bump: Yahoo-Finance purge & data stream
#         mapping optimization (single shared TastyTrade candle feed). No
