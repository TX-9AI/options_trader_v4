query.py  v4.7
v4.7  2026-09-01  r214 — 🔴 THE UNREALIZED LINE WAS SIGN-INVERTED ON EVERY
      CREDIT SPREAD, and had been since the panel was written. It applied the
      DEBIT formula `(now - cost)` to every structure. A credit vertical's
      `current_premium` is the SPREAD'S CURRENT VALUE — what it costs to buy
      back — and the position profits as that FALLS, so its P&L is
      `(credit - now)`, the mirror. A winning sweep printed as a loser and a
      losing one printed as a winner, on the one line the operator reads
      before deciding whether to intervene.
      ⚠️ DISPLAY ONLY, AND VERIFIED RATHER THAN ASSUMED. The same expression
      appears EIGHT times in exit_engine.py and every one is a DEBIT evaluator
      (`_evaluate_orb`, `_evaluate_sweep` — the retired long SweepReversal —
      `_evaluate_butterfly`, `_evaluate_adopted`), where it is correct.
      `_evaluate_condor_leg`, the credit path, already computes
      `(entry_prem - current_premium)`. So no exit decision was ever taken on
      the wrong sign and no trade was mis-managed; only the report lied. S3
      pins that, because the obvious "tidy-up" — making the eight consistent
      with this fix — would invert every debit exit in the book.
      🔑 THE CLASSIFIER IS `structure.is_credit_vertical`, the one the engine
      uses. r22's doctrine: DERIVE it, never add a column — a column fixes
      tomorrow and not today, because every position opened before the
      migration rehydrates without it and `None` reads as `False`, which is
      the exact failure, silently.
      ⚠️ `unrealized()` IS EXTRACTED so the check executes the real function.
      S2's first draft re-implemented the formula in the test and passed
      against the BROKEN version, because the copy was right — C.23.
      Found via day_trader_pro r236, which got the sign right in standings.py
      and deliberately did not copy this one (RPT.6).
v4.6
v4.6  2026-09-01  r210 (chunk B) — TODAY ONLY, AND ONE LINE PER ROW.
      Operator, 2026-09-01: PLANS "only TODAY's Plans"; GATES "only TODAY's
      gates and use abbreviations — it's spanning multi-line"; the closed
      table "get rid of the grade column & abbreviate".
      🔑 ONE DEFINITION OF TODAY. r172 inlined the 09:30 cut inside
      show_decisions; gates and plans need the same boundary now, so it is
      extracted as `session_start_epoch()` — three copies of a boundary is
      two chances for two of them to disagree about what day it is (§7). The
      cut is the OPEN, not midnight: a 06:00 maintenance wake writes real
      rows against a market that is not trading.
      ⚠️ GATES WAS ON A 24-HOUR WINDOW, which reached into YESTERDAY's
      session — a morning read mixed last afternoon's refusals with this
      morning's, separated by nothing but a bare HH:MM.
      🔴 AND THE `-4 hours` EDT HARDCODE WAS IN show_today TOO. Same class
      r125 fixed in the otv4 sensors and dtp r236 found in standings.py
      (RPT.8): right for eight months, silently wrong for four, and the
      failure is a table filtering on the WRONG DAY rather than one that
      errors. Read from the tz database now.
      ⚠️ LAST 10 CLOSED IS MERGED AWAY. Scoping both tables to today made
      them the same table — one filtered by date, one by a LIMIT that landed
      on the same rows. Two sections rendering one answer is §35's rot.
      ⚠️ `trade_row()` IS EXTRACTED SO THE WIDTH CHECK MEASURES THE REAL
      LINE. Q11's first draft rebuilt the format inside the test and measured
      its own copy — C.23, the r181 sizing checker that was green for two
      days because it re-implemented what it was pinning.
v4.5  2026-09-01  r209 (chunk A) — FOUR SECTIONS AND TWO PANELS REMOVED, on
      the operator's reading of what this dashboard is FOR. It is the PER-BOX
      report; an all-time or by-strategy rollup computed from one symbol's
      trades.db is a slice nobody acts on. His words, going bottom-up:
      Live Levels "don't care, take it out"; by setup type "just trivia in my
      opinion, useless by itself"; by setup grade "we don't have grades";
      by strategy "I don't need a per symbol snapshot of that"; all-time
      "irrelevant"; Character "keep, but not in query.py — it belongs in
      status, below the pin line."
      🔴 AND ALL-TIME WAS QUIETLY WRONG, not merely noisy. This file has no
      ENGINE EPOCH floor, so it pooled pre- and post-v4-split trades — 109 of
      them, reaching back through engines that no longer exist. r187 built
      that floor for exactly this contamination and this file never got it.
      ⚠️ BY SETUP GRADE was structurally empty: r152 deleted the scorer and
      every v4 write path hardcodes UNGRADED, so it had one bucket forever.
      ⚠️ THE CROSS-FLEET VERSIONS ALREADY EXIST AND ARE THE RIGHT HOME —
      day_trader_pro's trade breakdown (r187) groups by strategy, setup type,
      exit reason, symbol, hour and weekday across every box, epoch-floored.
      Nothing is lost; it is asked in the place that can answer it.
      ⚠️ A VIEW CHANGE, NOT A COLLECTOR CHANGE. `level_ledger` is still
      written and still read by the sweep and the fork; r81 keeps it unpurged
      in code because a recomputation cannot rebuild a biography. Q4 pins it.
      ⚠️ CHARACTER RENDERS NOWHERE UNTIL CHUNK C, and that costs nothing:
      r85 set BANDS_SET=False, so the panel has printed "No character
      recorded yet today" on every box since. Stated, not discovered.
v4.4  2026-08-31  r199 — EVERY OPEN POSITION GETS ITS OWN CARD, and a
      summed deployed figure heads them. `LIMIT 1` had been rendering one
      position as the whole book since r161 made the butterfly additive;
      CRM held a runaway and a butterfly on 2026-08-31 and showed one.
v4.3  2026-08-28  r172 — THE DECISIONS PANEL SHOWS TODAY'S SESSION, OR
      NOTHING. Operator: "Make the decision section only display today's
      decision, blank before 0930" and "If the box was up for maintenance the
      night before or even before the session open, don't display those
      decisions." It showed the newest plan_tick row per strategy WHATEVER ITS
      AGE — read at 09:16 ET it printed twelve rows from the previous evening,
      each flagged STALE, in a panel titled "the next tick, as the plans see it
      now." The cut is the OPEN (09:30 ET), not midnight, so a maintenance wake
      is excluded too; both the ENTER and EXIT halves are bounded. Asked in ET
      via ZoneInfo("US/Eastern"), which follows DST — a bare date.today() on a
      UTC box rolls the day at 20:00 ET. Pinned by tests/check_decisions_today.py
      (D2 mutation-proven).

v4.2  2026-08-27  r170 — THE DECISIONS PANEL. Operator: *"have query.py
      snapshot active trade decisions 'enter on' and 'exit on' for active
      plans. Trade log & all time performance should stay."* New
      show_decisions(): the newest plan_tick row per strategy (ENTER ON —
      the PREPARED trade and what it waits on, or the structural fault) and
      the newest <Strategy>/manage row per open position (EXIT ON — "if this
      or this, out"), each stamped and flagged ⚠️ STALE past 5 minutes.
      `--decisions` renders only the snapshot for the fleet reader in
      day_trader_pro devtools; the full dashboard (trade log, all-time,
      market) is the unchanged default.
v4.1  2026-08-25  r65 EXORCISM: every mention of the retired classification
      system removed - identifiers, comments, docstrings, schema. The word
      does not appear in this tree. Full accounting: REMOVAL_LOG (delivery).

Ad-hoc trade and store queries.

v4.0  2026-08-19  Ported from options_trader_v3 at the OTV4 split.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
Dated release framing and trivia are stripped; what remains is the
reasoning behind the thresholds, the design guarantees, and the
defects that recur when forgotten. WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires
this block be read before the file is edited.

query.py — OptionsTrader Performance Dashboard
None-guard the open-position setup_score display: condor
        legs log a NULL score (delta street-sign is NULL when Greeks are
        unavailable), which crashed the dashboard with TypeError on :.2f.
        Now renders "score=n/a" instead of raising.
v3.0 — original
Fix: read INSTRUMENT from systemd env via get_runtime_env()
W/L consistency: a $0 (scratch) trade is no longer counted
        as a loss (was pnl<=0), matching status.py (pnl<0). Reconciles the
        0W/0L vs 0W/1L mismatch between the two tools on breakeven trades.
                     config.py fallback is QQQ but live bot may be configured for SPX
repo-wide v3.0 bump: Yahoo-Finance purge & data stream
        mapping optimization (all market data now flows from the single
        shared TastyTrade candle feed — see data/candle_feed.py). No logic
        change in this file.
Options-specific: strikes, premiums, delta, P&L, butterfly legs, session stats.

    # all-time or by-strategy rollup on one box is a slice nobody acts on:
    # "I don't need a per symbol snapshot of that", "that's just trivia in my
    # opinion, useless by itself", "we don't have grades", "irrelevant".
    # ⚠️ THE CROSS-FLEET VERSIONS OF THESE ALREADY EXIST AND ARE THE RIGHT
    # HOME: day_trader_pro's trade breakdown (r187) groups by strategy, setup
    # type, exit reason, symbol, hour and weekday across every box, with an
    # ENGINE EPOCH floor so pre-2026-08-25 trades cannot contaminate it. This
    # file had no epoch filter at all, so its ALL-TIME numbers pooled the old
    # engines with the new ones — 109 trades reaching back past the v4 split.
    # Removing them removes a number that was quietly wrong, not just noisy.
    # ⚠️ BY SETUP GRADE was structurally empty: r152 deleted the scorer and
    # every write path hardcodes UNGRADED, so the section had one bucket.
