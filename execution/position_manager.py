execution/position_manager.py  v4.5
v4.5  2026-08-27  r166: the fetched premium is stamped on the record
      (`current_premium`) so the management plan reads the same number the
      exit engine just decided on.
v4.4  2026-08-27  r161: add_open_position() — append without replacing, for
      the butterfly firing alongside an open vertical.
v4.3  2026-08-24  r99 — flatten_all HOLDS credit verticals until
      VERTICAL_HOLD_TO_ET (15:45). It ran from 15:40 over every record and
      closed them with the debits; the 15:45 hold existed only in
      _evaluate_condor_leg, which the flatten window never reached.
v4.2  2026-08-25  r65 EXORCISM: every mention of the retired classification
      system removed - identifiers, comments, docstrings, schema. The word
      does not appear in this tree. Full accounting: REMOVAL_LOG (delivery).

Open-position tracking, pricing and lifecycle.

v4.1  2026-08-20  AUDIT F9: mark filters gain a 1e6 ceiling - NaN was already
      excluded (NaN > 0 is False) but a finite-absurd mark closed positions
      on phantom prints. Fail direction: None -> tick skipped.
v4.0  2026-08-19  Ported from options_trader_v3 at the OTV4 split.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
Dated release framing and trivia are stripped; what remains is the
reasoning behind the thresholds, the design guarantees, and the
defects that recur when forgotten. WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires
this block be read before the file is edited.

execution/position_manager.py — v3.4 — AUDIT A2.2: expose the open condor-leg
SWALLOW T1: this file's silent handler(s) now announce
        themselves once. Behaviour unchanged in every case; only the silence
        was the defect.
        count for the orphan announcement. The F5 warning was wired to a call
        site that cannot run while a leg is open (attempt_new_entry sits
        behind has_open_position, which reads the same DB), so it could never
        fire. The manage branch announces instead, counting from the records
        this manager already holds - no second DB read on the hot path.
v3.2 — AUDIT F6 pairing: price a spread by
        STRUCTURE, not by is_condor_leg. main v6.9 stops stamping
        is_condor_leg=1 onto TC.6 records, and this module's premium fetch
        keyed on exactly that flag (or strategy=="IronCondorStrategy") — so
        without this change a TC.6 record would silently fall to the
        single-leg pricing path. is_credit_vertical() reads only persisted
        columns (strategy / setup_type), so condor legs, both TC.6 row
        generations, and the rolled broken wing all price as short-long.
        Ships in the SAME commit as main v6.9, deliberately.
v3.1 — VEL.1 stashes current_delta
        alongside current_theta: breakeven velocity is |theta|/(|delta|*1440),
        so theta alone cannot answer whether the position is gaining or
        bleeding. Manages the single open options position.
remove the dead PAPER_FILL_SLIPPAGE_PCT import (audit
        defect T). This module has never priced a paper fill — entry pricing
        lives in entry_engine/main and exit pricing in exit_engine, both now
        via execution/limit_ladder. The unused import falsely implied this
        file was a third friction call site. Import-only change.
thread df_5m to exit_engine.evaluate() so trails can
        anchor to 5-minute FVGs (exit_engine v3.8 runner refinements). 1m is
        untouched and remains the structure-stop/BOS timeframe.
BOOK ONLY ON CONFIRMED FILL. _execute_exit() now consumes
        the FillResult from place_exit_order(): it books P&L ONLY when
        fill.confirmed is True and uses fill.fill_price (the ACTUAL close price
        — simulated mark in paper, broker fill in live), never the mark we
        passed nor entry-as-fallback. An unconfirmed result books NOTHING and
        leaves the row OPEN (anti-orphan invariant) so flatten_all's 15:45->16:00
        retry can act. Kills the hard-close $0.00 bookings. flatten_all still
        passes a chain (now supplied by handle_hard_close) so paper has a real
        mark to simulate against.
F5 FIX: trail updates now write to the trail_stop column
        via update_trail_stop() instead of overwriting stop_premium/update_stop.
        stop_premium stays the immutable entry-time -25% floor, so the exit
        engine's floor checks and exit_reason labels are truthful again.
v3.0 — original release
pass df_1m to exit_engine.evaluate() for strategy-aware
        ORB range violation and BOS exits
use live chain marks in paper mode for accurate P&L display;
        butterfly mark computed from lower + upper - 2×center legs
notify ORB engine when an ORB trade closes so it re-arms
        and watches for the next breakout attempt this session
        exits can fire for butterfly and condor leg positions
multi-position support for legged condors: hold up to two
        verticals at once (condor ONLY; every other strategy stays single),
        manage each independently, mark a leg as short_mark - long_mark, and
        invert P&L sign for credit spreads.
add remove_record() for the broken-wing roll (drops the old
        untested vertical when it is rolled).
pass realized P&L into record_win/record_loss so the risk
        manager can track NET daily P&L for the daily loss halt.
set_open_positions(): resume a recovered SET of open rows
        wholesale (1 normally, 2 for a legged condor) so startup recovery
        manages exactly the rows that survived stale-orphan reconciliation
        without dropping a condor leg.
flatten_all(): durable, complete forced close for the 15:45
        hard cutoff. Routes EVERY open record (all condor legs) through the full
        _execute_exit accounting so the DB row is actually marked closed and P&L
        booked — replacing main.py's old direct place_exit_order() that submitted
        an order but never wrote status='closed'. Returns trade_ids that failed
        to close so the caller can retry/escalate.
_fetch_current_premium PAPER fallback fixed: on a chain miss
        it returned the ENTRY premium, so any exit taken during a chain gap booked
        exit==entry (P&L=$0) — a real loss recorded as a scratch, and the exit
        logic blinded to the true premium. Now returns the LAST-KNOWN mark
        (update_current_premium), surrendering to entry only if never priced.
_execute_exit P&L is now credit-signed for an adopted SHORT
        (is_short_position), not just condor legs — so flatten_all/normal exits
        book a broker-adopted short's realized P&L with the correct sign.
repo-wide v3.0 bump: Yahoo-Finance purge & data stream
        mapping optimization (all market data now flows from the single
        shared TastyTrade candle feed — see data/candle_feed.py). No logic
        change in this file.
