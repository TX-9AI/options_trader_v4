execution/exit_engine.py  v4.1
Exit decisions: trails, structure stops, theta bleed, time.

v4.1  2026-08-20  AUDIT F0/F6/F7/F10. F0: the class was BISECTED - r38 landed
      _track_excursion at column 0 inside the class region, so evaluate and
      all 33 evaluators were nested locals of a telemetry function and EVERY
      intraday exit was dead code (AttributeError into the loop catch-all,
      every tick, every open position). Relocated below the class; the
      doctrine block above it carries the full mechanism. F6: the condor leg
      stop derives from hedge state - 15% unhedged / 25% hedged (TRADES.md 5,
      condor_stop 16 trades 19% win -$1,156 calibrated for a complete
      structure). F7: *_bars columns received 15s TICK counts; now poll-
      derived minutes - still COUNTED not timed, only the unit is honest.
      F10: RunawayContinuation routed to the ORB exit family its spec cites;
      the else-branch names its default out loud instead of absorbing
      strategies silently.
v4.0  2026-08-19  Ported from options_trader_v3 at the OTV4 split.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
Dated release framing and trivia are stripped; what remains is the
reasoning behind the thresholds, the design guarantees, and the
defects that recur when forgotten. WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires
this block be read before the file is edited.

execution/exit_engine.py — AUDIT F7: the BREAKOUT_VOLATILE exemption was scoped to
        `_breakout` records only, so a standalone/handoff continuation that
        ACCELERATED into a breakout IN ITS OWN DIRECTION was closed as a
        regime_flip while a breakout record survived the identical tape.
        Now ANY continuation survives, gated on the TREND VOTE agreeing -
        which is what v4.19's own comment already said should decide, and
        which the label cannot supply because BREAKOUT_VOLATILE has no
        direction. A long no longer survives a violent move DOWN.
v4.21 — Strategy-aware exit logic for all options positions.
🔴 AUDIT F1+F2+F4: THE v4.20 FIX NEVER BOUND, AND THE
        DISPATCH NEVER ROUTED. Two defects of the exact species v4.20 fixed,
        one hop away each, found by the adversarial audit and REPRODUCED AT
        RUNTIME (every failure below executed against 3d9e82e, not inferred):
        (F1) `is_trend_participation` was called at the top of
        `_evaluate_condor_leg` and NEVER IMPORTED into this module — NameError
        on every condor-leg tick and every legacy TC.6 row. The exception
        escapes _manage_one into the tick loop's error counter: 30 errors at
        15s ticks = sys.exit(1) about 7.5 min after any condor leg opens, then
        a systemd crash-loop until the 15:45 branch (which sits ABOVE the
        call) flattens it. The chain test asserted the STRING existed in this
        file — a mention, not a binding (WORKING_AGREEMENT section 20, at the
        import level). Import added, module level.
        (F2) `_execute_condor_leg` now writes strategy="TrendCreditSpread"
        (main v6.8) but evaluate() only routed "IronCondorStrategy" to the
        condor evaluator — every NEW TC.6 record fell to `_evaluate_sweep`,
        the DEBIT evaluator: KeyError 'trail_activation' on the first tick of
        a fresh record; after the crash-restart, target_premium=$0.05 (the
        nickel) read as a debit TP satisfied from tick one, so the position
        lived in the ORB post-target trail with SIGN-INVERTED P&L labels and
        lost the VERTICAL_HOLD_TO_ET exemption; TypeError once value decayed
        below the nickel. The dispatch now routes any record structure.py
        recognises as a credit vertical — both strategy names, legacy rows,
        and the rolled broken wing — to `_evaluate_condor_leg`.
        (F4) the ratchet high-water lived ONLY in self._condor_ratchet, so
        every bake reset an earned breakeven/+20% lock to the base -25% and
        re-opened the round-trip v4.1 exists to close. The earned level now
        rides the SAME persistence the directional trails use: emitted via
        decision.new_trail_stop (position_manager writes the trail_stop
        column) on the STANDALONE branch only — v4.17's formed branch
        deliberately neither applies nor updates it — and re-seeded from the
        column on restart. Only a value below base_stop can be a real condor
        ratchet; anything else is stale/foreign and ignored.
        Ships with tests/test_exit_dispatch_runtime.py — the first suite on
        this path that EXECUTES evaluate() with real record shapes (fresh AND
        rehydrated) instead of grepping source. Verified to fail against
        3d9e82e before this fix.
🔴 THE TC.6 BRANCH DIED ON RESTART. `is_trend_credit` IS
        NOT A COLUMN in the trades table — it lives only in the in-memory
        record. `get_open_trades_live()` does SELECT *, so **any restart
        rehydrated an open trend-participation position WITHOUT the flag**, this
        branch stopped firing, and the leg dropped into the condor ladder with
        the ratchet and the 25% premium stop. Same bug as the 08-14 identity fix,
        one level down: fixed for the process that OPENED the trade, still broken
        for any process that INHERITS it — and the hop that dropped it is a
        systemctl restart, which happens on every bake.
        Now DERIVED from `strategy` / `setup_type`, which are REAL COLUMNS and
        already round-trip. No new column, no migration — a column would fix
        tomorrow and not today, because rows opened before it would still
        rehydrate as None and read as False. The old flag is still honoured when
        present; only its ABSENCE stopped meaning "not a trend credit".
        See strategy/structure.py.
🔴 CNT.1 SHIPPED HALF A FEATURE AND THIS IS THE OTHER HALF.
        The entry branch (continuation_strategy, CNT.1, 2026-08-07) lets
        continuation OPEN on BREAKOUT_VOLATILE, taking direction from the trend
        vote and gating on ADX. `still_trending` here only ever accepted
        TRENDING_BULL / TRENDING_BEAR. So every `trend_continuation_breakout`
        trade was **BORN ALREADY FAILING ITS OWN EXIT TEST** — opened on tick N,
        closed on tick N+1 by reading the SAME UNCHANGED LABEL. THE LABEL NEVER
        FLIPPED, and `regime_flip` was a lie in the exit reason.
        Measured live 2026-08-14: 15-second holds, exactly one tick, repeating
        while the setup held. P&L symmetric noise — one tick of random walk minus
        the spread. **This has been true for every breakout continuation since
        2026-08-07.** Sits BEFORE bos_exit, so nothing else got a look.
🔴 LIVE FIX: THE TC.6 BRANCH HAD NO TERMINAL RETURN.
        When NEITHER breach NOR nickel fired it fell straight through to the
        ratchet and the 25% condor stop. `_execute_condor_leg` writes
        stop_premium = credit x 1.25 at entry, so a $0.06 credit put the stop at
        $0.07 — ONE CENT of widening closed the trade. Every TC.6 leg on the
        fleet stopped out within seconds of opening on 2026-08-14.
        THE MEASURED EV WAS HELD TO EXPIRY, UNMANAGED. A premium stop is a
        different trade, which is the entire reason the branch exists.
        ⚠️ THE TEST THAT MISSED IT asserted the branch CONTAINED two
        `return decision` statements. It did. Neither covered the path where
        neither condition fires — the path that was broken. **Counting returns
        proves nothing about the path that has none.** Now asserted on the
        branch's LAST STATEMENT via AST, and verified to FAIL against the
        shipped version.
THE RATCHET WAS CLOSING UNTESTED CONDOR LEGS. Operator:
        "the ratchet is inappropriate for this trade if the condor is fully
        formed. It should only be in effect if there's one side open" and
        "don't close a leg if it hasn't been tested - that's what the roll is
        for."
        MECHANISM: the base -25% stop only ever fires on the TESTED side,
        because a credit spread's value RISES as price approaches your short.
        The RATCHET does the opposite — it tightens the UNTESTED side's stop to
        breakeven at +20% and +20%-locked at +40% PRECISELY BECAUSE that side is
        winning. On the reversal the tested leg stops at -25% and the untested
        leg hits its ratcheted stop too. **A leg price never went near, closed
        by a stop that exists only because it was profitable.** That is the
        double-stop — 5 of 14 condor symbol-days had BOTH sides stopped — and it
        fires BEFORE the roll can be used, because the roll needs a tested side.
        FIX: while `_condor_sibling_open()` is true, the base floor is the ONLY
        stop; no tier, and the stored high-water is neither applied nor updated,
        so a leg returning to standalone resumes from a level it genuinely
        earned. Same interlock the take-profit already used, and it FAILS CLOSED
        (True on error) — treating a leg as part of a structure is the safe
        error.
        NOT CHANGED, deliberately: the adverse-regime-flip exit. It is
        direction-aware — a call spread exits only on TRENDING_BULL, which IS
        price rising toward that short strike — so it already fires only on the
        threatened side and is a tested-side exit.
        PRESERVED: `condor_stop` went 0% -> 19% win after the ratchet shipped,
        but that evidence came mostly from STANDALONES (18 of 46 legs never got
        a second side). Scoping keeps the gain where it was measured.
        ⚠️ ACCEPTED COST: an untested leg that runs to +40% and reverses now
        gives it back rather than locking +20%.
VEL.1: THE VELOCITY STALL, ladder step 2c. THE THIRD
        QUESTION, and until now nobody asked it. `orb_structure_stop` asks "did
        the thesis break?"; `_theta_bleed` asks "is my GAIN about to evaporate?"
        — its gate 1 is a gain floor, so a LOSING position is invisible to it.
        **A losing position that has STOPPED MOVING answers no to both** and
        falls to the -40% percentage floor, which is the ABSENCE of a mechanism
        rather than one. 2026-08-12 QQQ: 50 minutes and -42.2% with the
        underlying sitting BELOW the short entry the entire hold — directionally
        right, bleeding anyway, and nothing watching.
        STATISTIC — and it needs NO TARGET, which is why it generalises to every
        long-premium strategy: bev = |theta| / (|delta| * 1440) is the pts/min
        at which delta gains exactly offset decay; ratio = delivered / bev, and
        1.0 IS THE FLAT LINE.
        MEASURED, 15 sessions / 145 ORB trades against the chain archive
        (tests/velocity_feasibility.py — the FIRST tool to ever read it), among
        trades STILL OPEN at each mark:
              mark   winners p10   losers p50   losers p90
               5m       -21.1        -37.3         91.3   <- NO SEPARATION
              10m         3.9         -6.7         20.5
              15m        18.0          0.3         26.7
              20m        29.8          0.9         18.5   <- barely overlap
        The median surviving LOSER treads water at ~1.0 — exactly breakeven —
        while the bottom decile of WINNERS runs at 30x it.
        ⚠️ ORDER IS DELIBERATE: theta_bleed evaluates FIRST so a trade up 10-20%
        and stalled exits GREEN via that path. INDEPENDENT gates, never a
        combined score — the QQQ failure was two mechanisms each correctly
        saying "not my problem" with nothing aggregating that into "then NOBODY
        is watching."
        ⚠️ GRACE IS FORCED BY DATA: winners p10 at 5 min is -21.1, so the bottom
        decile of eventual WINNERS was moving AWAY. No check before 10 minutes.
        ⚠️ SHIPS OBSERVE-ONLY (OT_VELOCITY_ENFORCE=0). Floors rest on n=22 at the
        20-minute mark and are ORB-derived; other strategies are logged, never
        cut, whatever ENFORCE says.
        ⚠️⚠️ EVALUATION DATE: **FRI 2026-08-14**, and it carries a DELETE
        CRITERION — **zero firings across 08-13 and 08-14 means REMOVE THIS
        CODE.** A mechanism that never triggers is not cautious; it is dead code
        that still has to be read, tested and maintained. Standing rule agreed
        with the operator 2026-08-12 after three observers shipped in two days
        with no dates: an observer ships with an evaluation date and a delete
        criterion, or it does not ship. The cautionary case is the chain archive
        — written 07-23, first read 08-12, twenty days later.
        ⚠️ THE ENTRY-FILTER FORM OF THIS IDEA WAS MEASURED AND REJECTED:
        feasibility ratio at entry ran HIGHER for losers than winners at every
        percentile (losers p50 5.05 vs winners 3.87, n=145) — a wide range gives
        a distant target AND a big required move, so feasibility and difficulty
        are the same axis pointing opposite ways. Recorded so it is not rebuilt.
BOS PROTECTED LEVEL GETS A MINIMUM DISTANCE. The level is
        seeded from the LOW of the first bar closing above entry. On a pullback
        entry that bar is the smallest, earliest part of the resumption, so its
        low sits a hair under entry — the level lands INSIDE the symbol's own
        noise band and the next ordinary wiggle fires it.
        OBSERVED LIVE, not inferred: JPM in $1.26 12:49 -> out **$0.00** 12:50
        -> back in $1.26 the same minute. A null round trip — the exit condition
        was already true at entry. QQQ the same session fragmented ONE move into
        four scratches (+$30/+$45.50/+$35/+$7), same strike, three minutes, each
        exit immediately followed by re-entry because the setup was still valid.
        The re-entry loop is a SYMPTOM: it cannot happen unless the position
        closes, so a cooldown would suppress the symptom and leave the premature
        exit intact.
        Fix: floor the level at BOS_MIN_DIST_ATR * ATR from entry, ATR-scaled so
        it widens on NVDA and tightens on GLD automatically. Applied ONLY on the
        continuation path, which seeds with `underlying_entry`.
        ⚠️ min_dist=0 IS BYTE-IDENTICAL to pre-v4.15, ratchet included — a test
        pins that, because otherwise the kill switch is not a kill switch and
        there is no A/B control.
        ⚠️ `low - min_dist` IS NOT MONOTONE: a widening ATR can produce a new
        candidate BELOW the old level, silently slackening the stop exactly when
        volatility rises. Longs max(), shorts min().
        ⚠️ PRE-EXISTING DEFECT FOUND AND DELIBERATELY NOT PATCHED HERE: the
        generic/ORB caller (~966) seeds the tracker with `entry_prem` — the
        OPTION premium — while BOSTracker compares against df_1m UNDERLYING
        closes. A ~$1.26 premium against ~$352 closes means the first bar always
        beats peak_close, so that path seeds a level on bar one regardless of
        structure. Recorded rather than silently fixed; an ATR distance in
        premium units would be meaningless anyway.
CNT.2 INSURANCE GATE (2c), continuation only. BOS (2b) is
        the thesis invalidator and is deliberately ungated on P&L, but
        `BOSTracker.protected_level` is None until the trade makes a new closing
        high past entry — so BOS is structurally BLIND on a trade that goes
        wrong from the first tick, and that is exactly the population running to
        the floor at −29% with MFE +1% (45 trades, 11 sessions). 2c arms the
        already-stamped `underlying_stop` ONLY while `protected_level is None`
        and disarms the instant BOS has a level, so the handoff is exact and
        needs no time window. Structural, not premium-percent: a tighter premium
        floor was measured to net ~zero because it cuts winners that merely dip.
        Exits tag `insurance_stop` so the rollup scores it apart from
        max_loss_floor and bos_exit. `_bos` construction moved OUT of the df_1m
        guard so 2c cannot reference an unbound name. OT_CONT_INSURANCE=0 to
        disable. The level has never been read by anything that trades — treat
        it as an untested prior.
W.2 follow-on: the v4.12 throttle reused the ALERT set,
        so the census classified a debug-only handler as "pages". Own set now.
W.2: the v4.11 escalation guard was a bare `except: pass`
        inside place_exit_order — a SILENT swallow in the census's tier 1. Now
        DEBUG, once per process. No behaviour change.
EXIT LADDER LATENCY (N.5, log-only). place_exit_order() —
        the ONE seam every close routes through, paper and live — now stamps
        submit and fill instants, counts the passes the close took, flags
        escalation, and records the MARK AT TRIGGER. Written to the trade row
        via trade_logger v3.11 set_exit_latency() on a CONFIRMED close only.
        WHY THE MARK MATTERS MORE THAN THE MILLISECONDS: TC.2 has to choose a
        stop trigger (-40% vs 35% vs 25%) "calibrated against measured ladder
        fill-latency", and latency is not a cost until it is priced. The cost
        is (mark when the exit fired) - (price it actually filled at). Paper
        books the mark, so the two are equal by construction there — that
        equality is the PLUMBING PROOF that the capture is wired, not a result.
        The real distribution only exists in the live week.
        STATE LIVES ON THE RECORD, NOT ON THE ENGINE, because a live close is
        MULTI-TICK: the deadline can expire and the next tick RESUMES the same
        broker order. Keying off the record means submit_ts is the FIRST submit
        of that close attempt and the pass count spans the whole sequence; an
        engine-level counter would reset on restart and undercount exactly the
        slow closes the study is about.
        NOTHING IN THE TRADING PATH READS ANY OF IT. No exit decision, no
        price, no size changes — the capture runs after the FillResult exists.
CONDOR LEG MANAGEMENT v2 (user directive, data-driven).
        (a) RATCHETING STOP: +20% -> breakeven, +40% -> lock +20%, tightens only.
        (b) TIME-GATED TP at 25%, ONLY after CONDOR_ENTRY_CUTOFF_ET and ONLY
            when the opposite side is not open. Backtest, 18 standalone legs:
            TP@25% turned -$242.77 into -$8.43; on 28 condor legs a TP was WORSE
            at every level, confirming a condor leg must never be closed on
            profit — the only reason to close one is the roll.
        (c) Min-hold before TP: a quote-noise filter, not a structure mechanism.
        Nickel close, 15:45 hard close and the direction-aware regime exit are
        UNCHANGED (that regime exit has fired 0 times in 143 legs).
CONTINUATION EXIT REWORK (user directive). Three changes,
        all scoped to _evaluate_continuation — no other strategy touched:
        (a) TRAIL ANCHORS TO 5m FVGs. It was passing df_1m straight into
            _update_fvg_trail, bypassing the _fvg_frame() helper that ORB and
            sweep have used since v3.8. 1m gaps on a trend-continuation runner
            are noise-tight tripwires; 5m gaps are structurally meaningful and
            naturally wider. Now routed through _fvg_frame(df_1m, df_5m), so
            it also inherits the graceful 1m fallback when 5m is thin.
        (b) THETA-BLEED ENABLED. _theta_bleed had exactly ONE call site
            (_evaluate_orb) — continuation had NO theta protection at all, so
            a stalled winner decayed untouched toward the floor. Now called,
            with its existing four gates unchanged: >=THETA_MIN_GAIN_PCT gain,
            below the FVG_TRAIL_ARM_PCT trail ceiling, past the
            THETA_MIN_HOLD_MIN 20-minute blackout, and projected calendar-day
            decay >= the gain. Placed AFTER exhaustion so the smarter signal
            (momentum divergence) gets first refusal in the narrow overlap;
            theta only catches the genuinely STALLED case.
        (c) BACKSTOP 40%% -> 25%% via CONTINUATION_STOP_LOSS_PCT. The floor
            fallback no longer borrows the blanket MAX_LOSS_PCT.
RUNNER REFINEMENTS (all config/env-tunable; see config
        v2.0). Goals: let winners run harder, keep the loss unit deliberate,
        give 0DTE gamma room to breathe.
        (a) FLOOR 25%→40% for directionals: the -25% premium floor front-ran
            the impulsive-origin structure stop on normal gamma retests,
            stopping intact theses on noise. Floor fallbacks now read
            MAX_LOSS_PCT; the hard-stop label carries the record's ACTUAL
            floor pct (old records keep 25%, truthfully). Sizing is
            full-premium based, so at $1000 positions a floored trade now
            costs ~$400 — the daily cap should be set accordingly.
            Butterflies stay at 25% (BUTTERFLY_STOP_LOSS_PCT); condors
            unchanged.
        (b) 5-MINUTE FVG TRAILS (USE_5M_FVG_TRAIL): trails anchor to 5m gaps
            — structurally meaningful, naturally wider. 1m remains
            authoritative for the structure stop and BOS (speed-critical).
            evaluate()/_evaluate_orb/_evaluate_sweep accept df_5m; graceful
            1m fallback when 5m is absent.
        (c) FVG FLOOR CLAMP (FVG_FLOOR_MAX_LOCK_PCT=0.90): an FVG hugging
            price can no longer set a floor tighter than 90% of current —
            both the armed FVG trail and the post-target trail are clamped.
        (d) LEASH UN-INVERTED: post-target no-FVG fallback 0.85→0.75
            (POST_TARGET_TRAIL_LOCK_PCT, now in config) — proven runners no
            longer get a shorter leash than unproven ones.
        (e) SWEEP RUNNER MODE (SWEEP_POST_TARGET_TRAIL, default on): the +100%
            target_hit — the one hard TP among directionals — is replaced by
            the ORB post-target trail; env False restores it for A/B.
        Telemetry companion: trade_logger v3.8 records per-trade MFE/MAE
        (max/min premium seen) so every threshold above is tunable from
        evidence.
LIVE FILL-CONFIRMATION IMPLEMENTED (closes the Fable spec).
        _confirm_and_book_live_exit() is no longer a stub: it submits the close,
        captures the broker order id, polls to a bounded deadline
        (LIVE_FILL_POLL_SECONDS / LIVE_FILL_DEADLINE_SECONDS in config), and
        returns confirmed=True ONLY on a broker-confirmed fill at the broker's
        actual net fill price read back from per-leg fills — never the mark,
        never entry, never $0.00. Unfilled-at-deadline → cancel, resolve the
        cancel/fill race, return confirmed=False (position STAYS OPEN; the
        15:45→16:00 retry loop re-attempts and it pages once per trade/kind).
        PARTIALS: filled portion stashed on the record, remainder resubmitted
        next tick at a fresh mark; books once, at the quantity-weighted net
        price — never a partial as whole. IDEMPOTENT: a working order id is
        stashed on the record and RESUMED on re-entry, so retry ticks can never
        double-submit a close. Also fixed on the way (all live-only):
        (a) condor-leg verticals now close as ONE 2-leg spread order
            (BUY_TO_CLOSE short / SELL_TO_CLOSE long) — they previously routed
            to _close_single_leg, which sold the short symbol (wrong action)
            and orphaned the long leg at the broker;
        (b) spread closes are marketable LIMITs (tastytrade rejects MARKET on
            multi-leg): vertical debit capped at spread width, butterfly credit
            floored at one tick — the old MARKET butterfly close would have
            been rejected every tick;
        (c) SDK signed-price convention verified (v13.x): NewOrder.price is
            negative=debit / positive=credit and price_effect is IGNORED — a
            positive-priced buy-to-close would never fill;
        (d) adopted short single legs BUY_TO_CLOSE instead of selling more.
        PAPER PATH UNTOUCHED. Acceptance tests A–E:
        tests/test_live_fill_confirmation.py. Spec:
        FABLE_SPEC_live_exit_fill_confirmation.md.
FILL-CONFIRMED EXIT CONTRACT. place_exit_order() now returns
        a FillResult (confirmed / fill_price / order_id / partial), not a bare
        bool — the SHARED seam between paper and live so the two can't fight.
        PAPER: simulate the fill at the last-known mark (passed in) and confirm
        it in one pass; if no mark, decline (confirmed=False) rather than invent
        a price. LIVE: routes to _confirm_and_book_live_exit(), which MUST book
        only on a broker-confirmed fill at the ACTUAL fill price — currently a
        fail-loud stub (raises NotImplementedError) so flipping to cash before
        it exists can NEVER book an unconfirmed close at a fabricated $0.00.
        _submit_live_close() retained (submission != fill) for Fable to call.
        See FABLE_SPEC_live_exit_fill_confirmation.md. Fixes the 15:45 hard-close
        batch that logged every leg at +$0.00 (booked at entry premium).
F5 FIX (exit-reason integrity; behaviorally neutral).
        position_manager used to overwrite record['stop_premium'] (+DB) with
        every trail update, so the floor checks here (ORB #1b, sweep #2,
        adopted #2) fired AT THE TRAIL LEVEL and labeled every trail-armed
        exit 'hard_stop_25pct'/'stop_hit'/'adopted_stop_long' — including
        post-target exits at +100%+. Exit LEVEL was always correct (it was
        the trail); the LABEL lied, poisoning exit_reason distributions for
        Phase-3 calibration. Now: stop_premium is immutable (the true entry
        -25% floor), trails persist in the new trail_stop column, and
        _seed_trail_from_record() re-arms the in-memory trail on restart so
        recovery survivability is preserved. Same exit ticks, same exit
        prices — only the labels change to the truth.
DOC SYNC (no logic change). Three docstrings in this file
        contradicted the code beneath them and were actively dangerous: an agent
        or engineer reading them would "correct" working code back into a fixed
        bug.
        (a) `_evaluate_orb`'s docstring still described the PRE-v3.1 stop ("1-min
            candle closes back inside ORB range") — precisely the behaviour v3.1
            replaced. Rewritten to the actual, ordered trigger list, and it now
            states explicitly that the -25% floor and the structure stop are an
            AND, that there is NO BOS on ORB, NO max-hold, and that the 11:00 ET
            cutoff expires the ENGINE and not an open position.
        (b) The v1.1 changelog line describing that same old stop is now marked
            [HISTORICAL — do not restore].
        (c) `_evaluate_butterfly`'s docstring claimed a 25% profit target; the
            live value is BUTTERFLY_TP_PCT = 20%.
        Zero executable lines changed — verified by diff.
ORB STRUCTURE STOP now keys off the IMPULSIVE candle's
        origin, not the range boundary. The old rule (v1.1) exited on a 1-min
        close back inside the ORB range (close < orb_high for a long). That is
        "just entering the range," which by the strategy's definition is NOT an
        invalidation — the trade is allowed to breathe inside the range as long
        as it holds the impulsive (break) candle's origin. The stop now fires
        only on a 1-min CLOSE beyond that origin: below the impulsive candle's
        low for a long, above its high for a short, read from record
        `underlying_stop` (set correctly by orb_engine v3.1). Companion to the
        engine fix; the two ship together. The unconditional -25% premium floor
        (v1.6) is UNCHANGED and still evaluated first every tick — structure
        stop and dollar floor are an AND (either exits), catching thesis-death
        and total-premium-loss independently. Contained to _evaluate_orb.
v3.0 — original release
strategy-aware exit routing:
        ORB:     stop on 1-min close back inside range, trail at 50% TP, no BOS
                 [HISTORICAL — the range-boundary stop was REPLACED in v3.1 by
                  the impulsive-origin stop. Do not restore. See v3.1 above.]
        Sweep:   BOS on 1-min structure, hard stop 25%
        Butterfly: time/premium exits only, no BOS, no trail
ORB no longer hard-exits at 100% TP. Past 100%, the trail
        tightens to track the nearest unfilled 1-minute Fair Value Gap on the
        underlying (in the trade\'s favor), giving the position room to wick
        back and fill the gap without exiting on every dip, while still
        protecting the bulk of gains if the move actually reverses. FVG
        detection is scoped to 1m data only, matching ORB entry/exit logic
        which is always evaluated on the 1-minute timeframe.
long-option THETA PROTECTION + generalized FVG trail:
        (a) theta-bleed exit — a profitable long is closed when projected time
            decay over THETA_LOOKAHEAD_MIN would erase the current gain (the
            clock, not price, is the threat). Uses live per-contract theta.
        (b) FVG-anchored trailing stop for ALL longs (ORB + Sweep), armed at
            +FVG_TRAIL_ARM_PCT: parks at the far edge of the nearest unfilled
            in-favor 1m FVG (room to continue), runs with the % trail (max wins).
ADOPTED-position exit path: manages a position discovered
        open at the broker on a LIVE restart with no DB plan (see
        broker_reconcile) by the universal core of our rules — sign-correct
        max-loss stop (long/short), long-side profit trail, 15:45 hard close.
        No strategy-specific context required.
theta-bleed REWORK (merged onto the v1.4 adopted-position
        path; supersedes the v1.3 theta logic that shipped inside v1.4). The
        v1.3 check fired on the first green tick: on 07-07 and 07-08, ~50-58 of
        ~77-87 exits were theta_bleed at a median ~60s hold, capping trends
        while the day's P&L came from the trades that reached the trail.
        _theta_bleed is now bounded by four gates: (1) a minimum gain floor,
        (2) a trail ceiling (once armed, the trail owns the trade — theta goes
        silent so trends run), (3) a MIN-HOLD blackout after entry, and (4) a
        corrected per-CALENDAR-day decay projection (v1.3/v1.4 divided by
        RTH_MINUTES=390, overstating projected decay ~3.7x). No call sites
        change; the adopted-position exit path (_evaluate_adopted) is untouched.
ORB UNCONDITIONAL -25% HARD FLOOR (critical risk fix). The
        -25% dollar failsafe is universal by design and sweep/butterfly/adopted
        all enforce it directly (if current_premium <= stop_prem). ORB was the
        lone exception: it routed its floor through _update_trail, which returns
        None below the +50% trail activation — so any ORB trade that never armed
        the trail ran with NO dollar-loss stop and could bleed toward zero while
        the structure stop held (CRM 2026-07-09: -83%, underlying still above the
        range, trail never armed). _evaluate_orb now checks the floor DIRECTLY and
        UNCONDITIONALLY right after the hard-close check, mirroring the other
        three paths. _update_trail is unchanged (its de-arm is correct for the
        TRAIL; the floor no longer depends on it). Known failure mode — the
        adopted path's own comment already flagged _update_trail's de-arm.
repo-wide v3.0 bump: Yahoo-Finance purge & data stream
        mapping optimization (all market data now flows from the single
        shared TastyTrade candle feed — see data/candle_feed.py). No logic
        change in this file.
Exit triggers by strategy:
  ORB
    1. HARD CLOSE: 15:45 ET
    2. STRUCTURE STOP: 1-min close beyond the impulsive candle's origin
       (close < impulsive low for longs, close > impulsive high for shorts).
       Closing back inside the range alone does NOT stop — only a close past
       the impulsive origin does. Runs beside the unconditional -25% floor.
    3. TRAIL (below 100% TP): activates at 50% TP, trails at 75% of current premium
    4. TRAIL (at/past 100% TP): tightens to track the nearest unfilled 1m FVG
       in the trade\'s favor — no hard exit at target, position can keep running
  SWEEP REVERSAL
    1. HARD CLOSE: 15:45 ET
    2. HARD STOP: current premium <= 25% loss
    3. TARGET HIT: 100% TP
    4. BOS EXIT: 1-min break of structure against position
    5. TRAIL: activates at 50% TP
  BUTTERFLY
    1. HARD CLOSE: 15:45 ET
    2. MAX HOLD: 2.5 hours
    3. HARD STOP: net value <= 25% loss
    4. TARGET HIT: 25% of max profit
  ADOPTED (broker-discovered, no DB plan)
    1. HARD CLOSE: 15:45 ET
    2. MAX-LOSS STOP: sign-correct (long: premium <= stop; short: premium >= stop)
    3. LONG PROFIT TRAIL: standard trail to lock gains; short rides to hard close

        Returns an exit_reason when the position should be cut, else None.
        NEVER RAISES - an exit path that can throw is worse than one that
        occasionally declines to act.

        THE QUESTION NOTHING ELSE ASKS. `orb_structure_stop` asks whether the
        thesis broke; `_theta_bleed` asks whether a GAIN is about to evaporate
        (its gate 1 is a gain floor, so a LOSING position is invisible to it).
        A losing position that has STOPPED MOVING answers no to both, and the
        -40% percentage floor eventually catching it is the ABSENCE of a
        mechanism rather than one. On 2026-08-12 that cost a QQQ trade 50
        minutes and -42.2% while the underlying sat BELOW the short entry the
        entire time - directionally right, and bleeding anyway.

        NO TARGET IS USED. bev = |theta| / (|delta| * 1440) is the option's own
        physics, so this generalises to EVERY long-premium strategy rather than
        only ORB. The target-based form of the same idea was MEASURED AND
        REJECTED: feasibility ratio at entry ran HIGHER for losers than winners
        at every percentile (losers p50 5.05 vs winners 3.87, n=145) - a wide
        range gives a distant target AND a big required move, so feasibility and
        difficulty turn out to be the same axis pointing opposite ways. Do not
        reintroduce it.

        FOUR GATES:
          (1) GRACE    - no evaluation before VELOCITY_GRACE_MIN. Forced by the
                         data, not chosen: winners p10 at 5 minutes is -21.1,
                         i.e. the bottom decile of eventual WINNERS was moving
                         AWAY. Any earlier check kills those trades.
          (2) MEASURED - a strategy with no measured floor is evaluated and
                         LOGGED but never cut, whatever ENFORCE says.
          (3) FLOOR    - ratio must hold above winners-p10 * STRICTNESS at the
                         largest mark <= held.
          (4) CONFIRM  - VELOCITY_CONFIRM_TICKS consecutive breaches. QQQ crossed
                         back ABOVE breakeven at minutes 41-61 before dying at
                         70; a single-tick rule oscillates.

    # wrong" (that's the regime-flip / 40% floor below). Two exhaustion signals:
    #
    #   (1) EXTENSION-FROM-MIDLINE  — price stretched an abnormal distance from
    #       the BB midline (its mean). Cheap, early, stateless. FIRST TIER:
    #       tightens the trail hard (protect the stretched gain) but does NOT
    #       exit — a strong trend can stay extended.
    #   (2) MOMENTUM DIVERGENCE     — price prints a new run-favorable extreme
    #       while momentum (5m rate-of-change) is WEAKER than at the prior
    #       extreme: the move is continuing on fumes. CONFIRMATION: exits.
    #
    # COMBINE MODE (v1 = two-stage): extension tightens, divergence exits.
    #   ── NOTE TO FUTURE-SELF ─────────────────────────────────────────────
    #   A stricter "mode 3" was discussed and intentionally deferred: require
    #   BOTH signals to agree before exiting (divergence AND extension), which
    #   maps closer to how the operator actually trades — you don't bail on
    #   divergence alone if the move isn't also stretched. v1 ships the safer
    #   two-stage form (divergence-alone can exit). If you're reading this
    #   because you're reconsidering exits: the hook is the `_exhausted` combine
    #   step below — gate the exit on (divergence and extended) instead of
    #   (divergence) to become mode 3. Left as a code change, not a live flag,

        Books ONLY on a broker-confirmed fill at the broker's actual fill price.
        An unconfirmed close returns confirmed=False and the position STAYS
        OPEN — the caller (flatten_all 15:45→16:00 loop / _manage_one next
        tick) retries, and failures page once per trade per failure kind.

        PARTIAL-FILL POLICY (spec §4 — documented hybrid of (a)+(b)):
        a partial that completes within the deadline books as one fill. A
        partial still working at the deadline is cancelled; the filled portion
        is stashed on the record (in-memory: `_live_exit_fills`) and
        confirmed=False, partial=True is returned. The NEXT retry tick
        resubmits ONLY the remaining quantity at a fresh mark, and booking
        happens once — when cumulative fills cover the full position — at the
        quantity-weighted average net price. A partial is never booked as
        whole. (A mid-window process restart drops the in-memory stash; the
        startup broker_reconcile pass owns that path, as it does today.)

        IDEMPOTENCY / anti-double-submit: the working order id is stashed on
        the record (`_live_exit_order_id`). If a retry tick re-enters while a
        prior order is still working (e.g. cancel failed, or a prior pass
        errored mid-poll), we RESUME polling that order instead of submitting
        a second close against the same position.

# r38 landed `_track_excursion` as a module-level function PHYSICALLY INSIDE the
# class body region (column 0 at what was line 782). Python read it as the end
# of `class ExitEngine`; the ~2,000 lines below it — `evaluate` and all 33
# exit evaluators, indented as methods — silently became NESTED LOCAL FUNCTIONS
# of `_track_excursion`, created and discarded on each call, bound to nothing.
# The file compiled. `import main` passed. check_imports passed. Every checker
# passed, because NO CHECK EXECUTED AN EXIT. At runtime, the first
# `exit_eng.evaluate(...)` on any open position raised AttributeError into the
# loop's catch-all, every tick: no premium stop, no trail, no theta bleed, no
# nickel close, no condor ladder could ever fire — only the independent 15:45
# flatten_all() stood between an open position and the close. Found by the
# rewritten check_condor_spec (AUDIT F5), whose EXECUTING replacement raised
# the AttributeError its stub predecessor could never see. This function now
# lives where a module-level function belongs: BELOW the class it must not
# bisect. tests/check_exit_executes.py drives evaluate() so this class cannot
# fall apart silently again.
