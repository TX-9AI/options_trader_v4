execution/order_confirm.py  v4.0
Order acknowledgement and fill confirmation.

v4.0  2026-08-19  Ported from options_trader_v3 at the OTV4 split.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
Dated release framing and trivia are stripped; what remains is the
reasoning behind the thresholds, the design guarantees, and the
defects that recur when forgotten. WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires
this block be read before the file is edited.

execution/order_confirm.py — LIVE entry-order fill confirmation (audit defect O).
initial. The ENTRY-side mirror of exit_engine v3.5's
        fill-confirmation: submit is NOT a fill, and a position may be recorded
        ONLY at the broker's actual per-leg net fill price, for the quantity
        that actually filled.
        Entry semantics differ from exits in one deliberate way: an exit MUST
        eventually happen (the caller retries and escalates), but an entry is
        OPTIONAL — if the order doesn't fill by the deadline we CANCEL and walk
        away; the strategy re-evaluates on a later tick with fresh marks.
        There is no cross-tick resume for entries. The one thing we never do is
        walk away from contracts that DID fill: a partial entry is booked at
        its weighted net price for the filled quantity (it is a real position
        and must be managed), and the unfilled remainder is cancelled.
        Safety net: if the cancel itself fails and the order is still working
        after retries, we return unfilled with the order id and page — anything
        that fills afterward is picked up by broker reconciliation's ADOPT path
        (which exists precisely for broker positions with no DB plan).
Used by: main._execute_condor_leg (v3.7). Built to be reused by
entry_engine's single-leg and butterfly paths and condor_roll's rolled
vertical (audit defects O-remainder and P).
