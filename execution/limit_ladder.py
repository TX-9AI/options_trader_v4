execution/limit_ladder.py  v4.0
Escalating limit ladder for fills.

v4.0  2026-08-19  Ported from options_trader_v3 at the OTV4 split.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
Dated release framing and trivia are stripped; what remains is the
reasoning behind the thresholds, the design guarantees, and the
defects that recur when forgotten. WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires
this block be read before the file is edited.

execution/limit_ladder.py — Mid-anchored limit pricing for entries and exits.
SINGLE PAPER-PRICING AUTHORITY (audit defect T). Paper
        friction was split: singles/butterflies booked the bare mark (v1.2)
        while condor legs and rolled verticals still applied a 1% haircut in
        their own call sites. Both credit and debit paper fills now route
        through this module and honour ONE knob
        (config.PAPER_FILL_SLIPPAGE_PCT, default 0.0) applied AGAINST the
        trade. New: paper_fill_credit() — the credit-side twin of
        paper_fill_price(). Read at CALL time so the knob is monkeypatchable
        and env changes need no restart of this module.
hard-close escalation: 15:40 mark-limits -> 15:45 MARKET.
simplified to MARK-REPRICING (no synthetic tick-walk).
WHY THIS EXISTS
Before this, single-leg entries AND single-leg exits were MARKET orders, and
spread closes used a fixed $0.10 buffer past mark. On a $0.20 0DTE contract
with a $0.05 spread that is ~25% of premium round-trip — larger than any edge
the strategies are trying to capture. Every price in this system is derived
from mark ((bid+ask)/2), so the DECISION was made at mid while the FILL paid
the touch on both sides.
THE POLICY
We never cross the spread. We post AT THE MARK and re-post at the NEW mark
every tick (~15s) until filled.
  OPENS   Post at mark and let it sit. Re-priced to the current mark each tick.
          An entry that never fills costs nothing — the trade simply is not
          taken and the strategy re-signals next tick.
  CLOSES  Post at mark, and RE-PRICE to the current mark every tick until it
          fills. This is the important property: because the limit re-anchors
          to the live mark on every retry, it CHASES a falling market down
          instead of parking at a stale price. A stop triggered at 0.60 does
          not sit at 0.60 while the contract prints 0.40 — the next tick posts
          at the new mark, and the next, until it fills.
  The exit TRIGGER (e.g. -40%) decides WHEN to start closing. It NEVER anchors
  WHERE the limit sits. That separation is the whole point.
  THE ONE EXCEPTION — end-of-day flatten. 15:40 ET starts mark-limit reposts;
  15:45 ET sends a MARKET order, no exceptions, because an unfilled 0DTE at the
  bell is an expiry (and an assignment on a short leg), not an overnight hold.
  See hard_close_order_mode().
v1.1 NOTE: v1.0 shaded the limit one tick further past the mark on each urgent
attempt to synthesise a walk toward the touch. That was dropped — bid/ask are
not plumbed through to the exit path (only a combined mark is), so the shade
was guesswork about a spread we cannot see. Re-pricing at a live mark achieves
the same "follow the market" behaviour honestly and never pays a spread we
have not measured.

#  ENTRY LIMIT LADDER (v1.4 — 2026-08-13)  ·  FRC.2
# ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# Operator's manual technique, in his own worked example:
#   bid 1.95 / ask 2.35 -> mark 2.15, spread 0.40. "I would try 2.05, 2.10 and
#   then 2.15."
# So the rungs are fractions of the HALF-spread, out from the mark toward the
# near side, stepping every ENTRY_LADDER_STEP_SEC:
#       2.05 = mark - 0.50*half   ·   2.10 = mark - 0.25*half   ·   2.15 = mark
# Mirrored for a sell (2.25 / 2.20 / 2.15).
#
# ⚠️ WHY v1.0's VERSION WAS REMOVED AND THIS ONE IS DIFFERENT. v1.1 dropped the
# old shade because it moved a FIXED NUMBER OF TICKS past the mark without
# knowing the spread — "guesswork about a spread we cannot see". This is
# expressed as a FRACTION OF THE MEASURED SPREAD and takes bid/ask explicitly,
# so it is never guessing: a penny-wide quote shades a fraction of a cent, a
# dollar-wide quote shades twenty. Same objection, different mechanism.
#
# ⚠️ MINIMUM TICK. The operator's example splits 0.40 into clean nickels, but on
# a 0.04-wide quote the same fractions give 2.05 / 2.06 / 2.07 — steps the venue
# rounds away. Without a floor the ladder would post three identical prices and
# burn 45 seconds pretending to walk. Rungs that collapse onto a neighbour are
# DROPPED, so a narrow quote simply has fewer rungs.
#
# ⚠️ THIS IS PRICING ONLY. It does not decide whether to trade, and it must NOT
# be used to book a paper fill on its own — see `fill_model.would_fill()`.
# Posting an aggressive limit and ASSUMING it fills manufactures edge: the
# better the rung, the larger the fake gain.
