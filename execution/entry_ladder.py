execution/entry_ladder.py  v4.0
The entry ladder: start 25% in from the best price, step ONE VENUE INCREMENT
toward mark, never worse than mark, and never re-offer a refused price.

v4.0  2026-08-20  Built at the OTV4 split. Operator's spec, read back and
confirmed.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
WHY FILL QUALITY OUTRANKS EVERY SELECTION LEVER
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
FRC.1 measured the fleet's gross edge at **+$2.70/trade against $126/trade of
round-trip friction - about 2% of the spread it trades in.** Capturing half the
half-spread on entry is worth on the order of **$31/trade**. **Fill quality is
an order of magnitude larger than anything on the trade-selection list**, and
this file is where it is captured or given away.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THE SPEC, IN THE OPERATOR'S OWN EXAMPLES
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Spread 1.00 (bid 0.00 / ask 1.00, mark 0.50), SELLING:
  · $0.05 increments -> start .75, then .70 .65 .60 .55 .50   (six rungs)
  · $0.10 increments -> start .70, then .60 .50               (three rungs)

**Granularity falls out of the venue increment, not a fraction list.** A tighter
grid gives more rungs and more chances at a better fill. The v3 ladder used a
FIXED `[0.50, 0.25, 0.00]` and could not express that: on a dime grid it posted
three prices whether or not more were available, and on a penny grid it skipped
dozens of postable levels between them.

⚠️ 25% AND NOT 50%. Operator: *"always start at 25% of best price to not waste a
lot of time on hopeless attempts."* The half-spread opener spent a fill window
on a price the book was never going to take.

⚠️ .75 -> .70 ON A DIME GRID ROUNDS **TOWARD MARK**, deliberately. v3's
`round_to_increment` rounded a sell UP - away from mark - reasoning that
nearest-rounding would make half the rungs more aggressive than specified. That
is the right instinct for a rung you intend to hold, and the wrong one for an
OPENING rung whose entire purpose is to be plausible. Rounding away from mark
recreates the hopeless attempt the 25% start exists to avoid.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THE THREE RULES, AND THEY COMPOSE IN THIS ORDER
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
1. **RATCHET.** The rung index only ever advances. Operator: *"If it's not
   accepting 80 at the first attempt, it won't accept 80 at the next attempt as
   price fluctuates - 80 is off the table."* A refused price never returns, even
   if the market moves back through it.

   ⚠️ THIS IS THE RULE v3 DID NOT HAVE. `entry_ladder_prices` recomputed every
   rung from the LIVE quote each cycle, so a mark that drifted up could place
   rung 2 at or above rung 1 - re-offering a level already refused and burning
   the fill window on it.

2. **REPRICE.** Each attempt recomputes from the CURRENT mark, not the
   entry-time one. A ladder anchored to a stale mark chases a market that has
   already left.

3. **MARK FLOOR - never post worse than mark.** Operator: *"If Mark ever turns
   out to be better than our first offer or subsequent offers, take Mark."*
   Selling posts `max(rung, mark)`; buying posts `min(rung, mark)`.

   ⚠️ THIS RESOLVES THE CONFLICT BETWEEN 1 AND 2. If the mark rises past the
   last refusal, the ratchet alone would hold the order BELOW mark - posting
   worse than the market is offering. The floor takes mark instead, which is the
   terminal rung anyway, so the ladder simply arrives there early. **On a market
   moving in your favour this collapses to mark and fills. That is correct: the
   rungs only ever existed to try for BETTER than mark.**

⚠️ AND IT APPLIES TO EVERY ORDER - debits and credits alike, every strategy.
Not a per-strategy option.

    RULE THE OPERATOR STATED MOST FIRMLY. `_snap_toward_mark` fell through to
    NEAREST rounding when `px == mark`, so a mark on a half-cent snapped the
    wrong way: NFLX bid 0.45 / ask 0.50 gave a BUY table of [0.47, 0.48] with
    mark 0.475 — the terminal rung paying a cent ABOVE mark.

    ⚠️ AND THE CLAMP COULD NOT SAVE IT. Rule 3 in `next_price` clamps a buy to
    `mark` — 0.475 — which is UNPOSTABLE on a penny grid. The venue rejects it
    or silently adjusts it, and `tick_size.py` says exactly what that costs:
    "a silently adjusted limit is a fill at a price nobody chose with nothing
    in the logs to explain it."

    ⚠️ SO THE TERMINAL RUNG ROUNDS IN OUR FAVOUR. Operator, 2026-08-24: "always
    round in our favour." Buying takes the grid price at or BELOW mark; selling
    takes the grid price at or ABOVE mark. Worst case we post exactly mark when
    mark is already on the grid; otherwise we keep the fraction of a cent
    instead of giving it away. On a 5c spread half a cent is 10% of the
    half-spread, on the rung most likely to fill.

    ⚠️ THIS IS THE TERMINAL RUNG ONLY. The intermediate rungs still snap TOWARD
