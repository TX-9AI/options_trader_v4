execution/entry_engine.py  v4.2
v4.2  2026-08-25  r65 EXORCISM: every mention of the retired classification
      system removed - identifiers, comments, docstrings, schema. The word
      does not appear in this tree. Full accounting: REMOVAL_LOG (delivery).

Entry dispatch and slot assignment.

v4.1  2026-08-20  AUDIT F4: relaxed_entry copied signal -> record. Without it
      the column was DEFAULT 0 on every row while the schema claimed the
      relaxed population was separable.
v4.0  2026-08-19  Ported from options_trader_v3 at the OTV4 split.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
Dated release framing and trivia are stripped; what remains is the
reasoning behind the thresholds, the design guarantees, and the
defects that recur when forgotten. WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires
this block be read before the file is edited.

execution/entry_engine.py — Options order placement via TastyTrade SDK.
DOC TRUTH + shared paper authority (audit defect T).
        v3.8 said paper "books the MARK", which was true only because the
        knob was being ignored here while condor legs still applied it. Paper
        debit fills still route through limit_ladder.paper_fill_price — no
        call-site change — but that helper (v1.3) now honours
        PAPER_FILL_SLIPPAGE_PCT for every path uniformly, default 0.0 = the
        mark. So the v3.8 behaviour is the DEFAULT, not a hardcode, and the
        knob is a fleet-wide stress lever again.
MARK-LIMIT ENTRIES. Single-leg entry was a MARKET order
        (paid the ask while the signal was scored on the mark). It now posts a
        LIMIT at the mark and lets it sit; unfilled orders are cancelled by
        confirm_order_fill and the strategy re-signals next tick against a
        fresh mark. Paper fills book the MARK for both single-leg and
        butterfly (was mark * (1 + PAPER_FILL_SLIPPAGE_PCT)) so paper and live
        trade on the same principle — the residual gap is no-fill risk, not
        slippage.
ENTRY FILL-CONFIRMATION (audit defect O, parts 2+3).
        Records are written ONLY for broker-confirmed fills at the broker's
        actual fill price, for the quantity that actually filled — never on
        submission, never at the signal mark, never at our limit.
        SINGLE LEG: still a MARKET order, but the fill price is now READ BACK
        from the order's fills via order_confirm (the old code booked
        `placed.price or signal.entry_premium` — a market order has no
        .price, so live entries were ALWAYS recorded at the signal mark).
        BUTTERFLY: rebuilt. (a) debit priced NEGATIVE per the SDK's signed
        convention (the old positive price demanded a CREDIT to open a debit
        fly — could never fill; price_effect is ignored by current SDKs and
        is gone); (b) fill detection is a bounded poll via
        confirm_order_fill, not an instant status peek (which always saw
        Received/Routed and churned place→cancel→place); (c) the
        double-position race is closed: a second attempt is placed ONLY after
        the first is confirmed dead with zero fills — an uncancellable order
        stops the ladder, pages, and is adopted by reconcile if it fills;
        (d) a PARTIAL fill is booked at its weighted net for the filled size.
        Butterfly records now persist lower/center/upper leg SYMBOLS —
        without them the v3.5 live close and reconcile leg-matching both fail.
        enter() sizes the record from the CONFIRMED quantity. Paper is
        unchanged in shape (fills at mark ± PAPER_FILL_SLIPPAGE_PCT in one
        pass) and returns the requested quantity — mirroring live as closely
        as a simulator without a book can.
v3.0 — original release
store orb_range_high/low in TradeRecord so exit_engine
        can detect ORB range violations on 1-min candle closes
repo-wide v3.0 bump: Yahoo-Finance purge & data stream
        mapping optimization (all market data now flows from the single
        shared TastyTrade candle feed — see data/candle_feed.py). No logic
        change in this file.
Order types:
  - Single-leg (ORB, SweepReversal): MARKET order, fill price read back from
    the broker's fills (bounded confirmation poll).
  - Multi-leg butterfly: signed-DEBIT limit at MID; if confirmed dead unfilled,
    ONE retry improved by LIMIT_IMPROVE_TICKS. Never pays worse than
    mid + 1 tick; never places attempt 2 while attempt 1 might still fill.
Paper mode: books limit_ladder.paper_fill_price (the mark by default;
mark ± PAPER_FILL_SLIPPAGE_PCT when the stress knob is set). No real order.
