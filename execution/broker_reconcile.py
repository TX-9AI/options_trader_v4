execution/broker_reconcile.py  v4.0
Reconciles local state against the broker.

v4.0  2026-08-19  Ported from options_trader_v3 at the OTV4 split.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
Dated release framing and trivia are stripped; what remains is the
reasoning behind the thresholds, the design guarantees, and the
defects that recur when forgotten. WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires

execution/broker_reconcile.py — LIVE broker⇄DB position reconciliation.
PHANTOM P&L RECOVERY. New pure helpers so a phantom (DB
        open, broker flat — e.g. Jason closed it manually at the broker) can be
        booked at its REAL fill instead of the forced $0.00:
          match_closing_fills(record, orders) — scan broker order history for
            CLOSING legs matching the record's symbols (BUY_TO_CLOSE on short
            roles, SELL_TO_CLOSE on long roles; opening orders never match),
            aggregate per-leg fills across however many orders the manual close
            took, and return (closed_qty, net_price) on the record's own mark
            basis (vertical: short−long; butterfly: lower+upper−2·center).
          phantom_pnl(record, net_price) — the SAME credit-signed P&L math as
            position_manager._execute_exit, so a recovered phantom feeds
            DAILY_LOSS_LIMIT the truth.
        Both are pure (no SDK, no DB) and unit-tested in
        tests/test_phantom_pnl_recovery.py. Callers (main.py v3.6) fetch order
        history once per reconcile pass and fall back to the flagged $0.00 only
        when NO closing order exists (legitimately: expiry, assignment).
        CAVEAT (documented, accepted): matching is by option symbol — two
        same-day records on identical strikes could cross-match; 0DTE re-entry
        on the exact same strikes is rare and the reason field flags recovery.
initial: the brokerage is the source of truth for whether a
        position EXISTS; the DB supplies the management plan. Builds a plan of
        keep / adopt / close-phantom / anomaly from broker positions + DB live
        rows. Pure logic (no SDK, no DB writes) so it is fully unit-testable; the
        caller performs the DB writes and alerts. PAPER never calls this — the DB
        is truth there.
leg_roles(): split a record's option symbols into (short,
        long) so an intraday reconcile can detect a broker-closed SHORT leg
        while the long remains (build_plan only checks any-leg presence).
repo-wide v3.0 bump: Yahoo-Finance purge & data stream
        mapping optimization (all market data now flows from the single
        shared TastyTrade candle feed — see data/candle_feed.py). No logic
        change in this file.
Rules (agreed design):
  - A broker position already represented by a LIVE DB row  -> KEEP (manage from
    the existing plan).
  - A broker position with NO DB plan                       -> ADOPT and manage
    on its own merit: entry = broker average_open_price, side from the broker,
    stop = entry * (1 ∓ ADOPTED_STOP_PCT), managed by the generic adopted exit.
  - A LIVE DB row with NO matching broker position          -> PHANTOM: close it
    (broker wins on existence).
  - Pairing is for LABELLING only: a short leg with a matching long (same
    underlying+expiry+type) is tagged as part of a spread; a short with no such
    long is flagged an ANOMALY (per the account's margin reality a naked short
    should be near-impossible) — but it is still adopted and managed, loudly.
