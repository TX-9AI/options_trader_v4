execution/fill_model.py  v4.0
Paper fill modelling.

v4.0  2026-08-19  Ported from options_trader_v3 at the OTV4 split.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
Dated release framing and trivia are stripped; what remains is the
reasoning behind the thresholds, the design guarantees, and the
defects that recur when forgotten. WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires
this block be read before the file is edited.

execution/fill_model.py — options_trader_v3 — (FRC.2)
DID THE QUOTE ACTUALLY COME TO OUR LIMIT?
⚠️ THIS MODULE EXISTS BECAUSE THE ENTRY LADDER IS DANGEROUS WITHOUT IT.
`limit_ladder.paper_fill_price` books the posted price and is explicit about the
assumption: *"paper is now honest about PRICE but still optimistic about FILL
RATE — the residual gap to model later is no-fill risk, not slippage."* That is
defensible when paper posts AT THE MARK, because a mark-limit usually fills.
It stops being defensible the moment paper posts INSIDE the spread. An
aggressive limit that is assumed to fill books a better price on every single
trade and never models the entries that were missed — **the more aggressive the
rung, the larger the fake gain.** Rung 1 would look like the best change this
system has ever made, and the improvement would be entirely manufactured.
So: no shading without a fill test. This is that test.
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
THE TEST, and why it is deliberately conservative
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
A BUY limit at L fills only if someone sold at or below L while it rested. The
honest proxy available on this box is the UNDERLYING'S OWN 1m tape via the
option quote we already read each tick:
    BUY  fills if the ASK trades down to L or lower   (ask <= L)
    SELL fills if the BID trades up to L or higher    (bid >= L)
WHY THE FAR SIDE, NOT THE MID: to buy at L, someone must be OFFERING at or
below L. That is the ASK reaching down to us, not the mid drifting. Testing
against the mid would report a fill whenever the mid crossed L, which happens
roughly twice as often — and would recreate exactly the optimism this module
exists to remove.
QUEUE POSITION IS NOT MODELLED and cannot be from this data. A resting limit AT
the touch may still not fill if size ahead of it absorbs the trade. So even this
is optimistic — but it is optimistic about QUEUE, which is second-order, rather
than about PRICE, which is first-order and was previously unmodelled entirely.
State it, do not paper over it.
⚠️ CLOSED TICKS ONLY. A quote sampled mid-tick is a snapshot, not a range. The
caller passes the ticks OBSERVED WHILE THE ORDER RESTED, and each one is a real
sample of where the market was. Feeding a forming bar would count a level that
had not printed.
