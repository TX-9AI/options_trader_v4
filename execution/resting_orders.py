execution/resting_orders.py  v1.1
v1.1  2026-09-01  r207 — PAPER FILLS THE WHOLE OFFER. The v1.0 paper branch
      compared the UNDERLYING price against the OPTION STRIKE
      (`price >= row["strike"]`) and called that "the underlying has come back
      to the level the offer was anchored on". Those are different quantities:
      on a short ORB with a 705 put and spot at 709 it is trivially true, so
      the model would have filled instantly on any OTM offer and never on an
      ITM one — backwards, and undetected only because `_place_single_leg`
      short-circuited to the paper filler before an offer was ever placed, so
      this branch has never executed. Operator, 2026-09-01: "in paper mode,
      they ALL fill." The comparison is deleted rather than corrected; there
      is no partial-fill evidence to model and inventing one is worse than
      admitting the residual gap.

THE ORB STANDING OFFER: one limit at mark, posted once, left to rest.

v1.0  2026-08-30  r195 — backlog ORB.2. Operator, 2026-08-30: *"leave it as a
      standing offer until it gets fully filled, or the trade sequence makes it
      ineligible (ran away past the 50% TP or price came back and stopped out
      on the structure)."*

🔑 WHY ORB LEAVES THE LADDER, AND ONLY ORB. The entry ladder (r104,
`ladder_registry` over `entry_ladder.LadderState`) exists because of FRC.1: the
fleet's gross edge is +$2.70/trade against $126/trade of round-trip friction,
so capturing half the half-spread is worth ~$31/trade — an order of magnitude
more than anything on the trade-selection list. That arithmetic is right for
the credit spreads, the butterfly and the runaway, and they keep the walk.

It is wrong for ORB, because the walk buys that $31 by SPENDING TICKS, and an
ORB entry that misses its retest window does not lose $31 — it loses the whole
setup. Operator's words, kept verbatim because they are the reasoning a future
reader needs: *"I don't want to blow an entry trying to save $25 by dicking
around over pennies."* The edge is in being IN the break, not in the fill.

⚠️ THIS IS A BIGGER CHANGE THAN "LET THE ORDER SIT". Before r195 an ORB entry
posted ONE RUNG PER TICK with a ~5s per-rung deadline (`_rung_deadline()` is a
quarter of LIVE_ENTRY_DEADLINE_SECONDS), was cancelled, and the strategy
re-signalled next tick against a fresh quote — an active price walk. r195
replaces that with a single DAY limit that is never re-priced. The file's own
v3.8 header still described the pre-ladder "post at mark and let it sit"
behaviour, which r104 had already superseded; do not read that comment as
current.

━━ THE THREE SURFACES (operator's ruling, and the reason this module is small)
  1. PLACEMENT is a logged EVENT. It is never a position.
  2. OPEN POSITIONS are a projection of the BROKER's positions endpoint,
     grouped by strike+type — discovered, never declared by us.
  3. WORKING ORDERS — this file — are their own informational surface, kept
     OFF the trades log.

🔑 SURFACE 2 IS WHY THERE IS NO REMAINING-QUANTITY HERE. `get_open_option_positions()`
already returns `{symbol, underlying, quantity, direction, average_open_price}`
and its own docstring already says *"the brokerage is the source of truth for
whether a position exists"*. **The broker averages the basis across partial
fills**, so accretion needs no arithmetic of ours and nothing to reconcile. We
record what we OFFERED; the broker tells us what we OWN.

⚠️ ADOPTION IS SCOPED TO A STRIKE/SIDE WE HOLD AN OFFER FOR, AND THAT IS NOT A
DETAIL. `_intraday_reconcile` deliberately *"does not adopt brand-new broker
positions intraday, so a manual trade you place is left alone."* Widening that
refusal is only safe because this file says which contract we asked for — which
is what makes surface 1 load-bearing rather than decorative. A discovery path
that adopted any new broker position would hijack the operator's own fills.

⚠️ DURABLE, NOT IN-PROCESS. State lives in its own SQLite table beside the
trades DB, following r179's precedent: an offer must survive a restart, because
a bot that forgets it has a live order at the broker is exactly how an orphan
is born. r178's in-process lock is the failure this avoids.

━━ CANCEL TRIGGERS (operator's set, and the ONLY set)
  • FULLY FILLED        — nothing left to cancel
  • PAST THE 50% TP     — the runaway case; the contract is dearer than our
                          offer anyway, so this is tidiness more than defence
  • STRUCTURE STOP      — 1m close beyond the impulsive low/high, the SAME
                          close-based test the exit engine uses, evaluated on
                          the same tick as the exit
  • EOD FLATTEN         — backstop; nothing may be working overnight

⚠️ 11:30 IS NOT A CANCEL TRIGGER. Operator: *"1130 is the cutoff for new orb
entries or a single attempt runaway that has not yet fired during the
session."* It gates PLACING. An offer placed in-window keeps accreting after
it, so a position can open in the afternoon — deliberate, and the debit block
does not apply because the ORDER is not new.

🔑 A RE-ARM DOES NOT CANCEL THE OFFER, AND I HAD THIS BACKWARDS. Operator:
*"if price reenters the range without hitting the stop then the original trade
geometry STANDS as VALID."* He is right, and the exit engine already agrees —
`exit_engine.py:990`: *"Merely closing back inside the range does NOT stop the
trade: price is allowed to breathe inside the range as long as it holds the
impulsive origin."* The engine's attempt test is the RANGE BOUNDARY; the trade's
test is the IMPULSIVE ORIGIN, which sits below it. Price in that gap kills the
attempt and not the thesis, and cancelling there would judge the offer more
harshly than the position it is trying to become.

⚠️ THE DUPLICATE-OFFER PROBLEM IS SOLVED UPSTREAM, NOT HERE. r195 stops
the engine re-arming at SIGNAL time — it now waits for the trade to resolve —
and main.py refuses to ask ORB for a signal while an offer is working. No
second attempt can form while this one stands, so the offer never needs
cancelling for a reason that is not its own stop.

    🔑 THE BROKER DECLARES THE POSITION, NOT US. Operator's ruling: *"broker-side
    open positions is the only thing that can declare an 'open' position in the
    live book."* So this reads `get_open_option_positions()`, finds the group
    for THIS contract, and books what the broker says we own — quantity and
    `average_open_price` both. We never compute a blended basis: the broker has
    already done it across every partial, and a second averaging is a second
    answer.

    ⚠️ ADOPTION IS SCOPED TO THE CONTRACT WE OFFERED ON. `_intraday_reconcile`
    deliberately *"does not adopt brand-new broker positions intraday, so a
    manual trade you place is left alone."* That refusal is a feature. This
    widens it by EXACTLY ONE symbol — the one named on a WORKING offer we
    placed — which is what makes the placement log load-bearing rather than
    decorative. A manual fill on any other contract is still left alone.

    ⚠️ IDEMPOTENT BY trade_id. The supervisor calls this on every fill DELTA,
    so a 4-then-10 partial calls it twice. The second call must UPDATE the
    existing row's size, not open a second position — double-booking a position
    that exists once at the broker is worse than not booking it at all.
