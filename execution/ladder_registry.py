execution/ladder_registry.py  v1.1
v1.1  2026-08-24  r99 — price_for accepts a zero bid (was rejecting the
      header's own example) and the stop escalation returns mark snapped to
      the venue grid in our favour, never a raw half-cent. Still uncalled.

THE OWNER OF `LadderState` BETWEEN TICKS. One rung per tick means the walk IS
multi-tick, so somebody has to hold the ratchet — and nobody did.

v1.0  2026-08-24  r98. Built because `execution/entry_ladder.py` has been a
complete, correct, UNCALLED implementation since 2026-08-20.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AND WHY IT IS SEPARATE FROM `entry_ladder`
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
`entry_ladder.LadderState` is a pure state machine: give it a quote, it gives
you a price; tell it a price was refused, it advances. It is correct and it is
stateless about WHICH order it belongs to.

The wiring needs the other half — a walk that persists across ticks, keyed to
the intent it is walking for. Put that inside `LadderState` and the state
machine grows a lifetime it should not own; leave it out and every call site
invents its own registry, which is the divergent-lineage failure
`credit_vertical.py`'s header describes.

⚠️ **A LADDER THAT RESETS EVERY TICK IS NOT A LADDER.** It re-offers rung 1
forever, which is v3's exact defect: *"`entry_ladder_prices` recomputed every
rung from the LIVE quote each cycle, so a mark that drifted up could place rung
2 at or above rung 1 — re-offering a level already refused and burning the fill
window on it."* The ratchet only means anything if the state outlives the tick.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THE KEY, AND WHY IT IS NOT THE ORDER ID
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
There is no order id yet when the price is being chosen — that is the whole
point. So the key is the INTENT: what we are trying to do, stable across the
attempts that make up one walk.

    <symbol>|<action>|<structure>      e.g.  "NFLX 260828C81|open|single"
                                             "QQQ|close|condor_leg:put"

Two different intents never share a ratchet; the same intent re-attempted on
the next tick resumes its own.

⚠️ **CLEARED ON FILL OR ABANDON, NEVER LEFT TO ROT.** A stale walk would apply
yesterday's refusals to today's order and open at a price the ratchet has
already ruled out — the walk would start mid-ladder against a quote that has
nothing to do with it. `clear()` on fill; `sweep_stale()` drops anything
untouched for longer than one session leg.

⚠️ **LOST ON RESTART, AND THAT IS RECORDED RATHER THAN DEFENDED.** This does not
ride a column, so a bake mid-walk forgets the ratchet and may re-offer one
already-refused price. WORKING_AGREEMENT 22 says state that must survive a
restart rides a column; the judgement here is that one duplicate rung is cheaper
than a schema migration, and it is written down so the next reader can disagree
with a fact rather than rediscover it.

⚠️ **PAPER NEVER TOUCHES THIS.** Paper pricing is `limit_ladder.paper_fill_*`
and stays the single paper authority. A ladder in paper would model fills we
have no evidence for — the ladder's value is measured in LIVE fills or not at
all.
