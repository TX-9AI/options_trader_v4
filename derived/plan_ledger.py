derived/plan_ledger.py  v4.1
v4.1  2026-09-01  r212 (chunk D) — A PLAN CLOSES WHEN ITS TRADE DOES.
      🔴 ROWS OPENED BY `PlanTick.take()` WERE NEVER CLOSED BY ANYTHING.
      `transition()` had exactly two callers — main.py's ORB plan and the
      condor's `_plan_id` — so every plan opened through `Plan._ledger_open`
      (runaway, sweep, butterfly, TCS, condor leg two) kept `closed_ts` NULL
      for the whole session and `live_plans()` returned it forever. QQQ,
      2026-09-01: SEVEN `RunawayContinuation TRIGGERED @ 708.43` rows, every
      one flagged LIVE, while six of those trades had closed hours earlier.
      🔴 AND r199 MISDIAGNOSED THIS AS DUPLICATION. It saw two rows for one
      strategy at one trigger, called them duplicates and collapsed them for
      display. They were never duplicates — they were distinct plans that had
      not been closed, and the collapse merged trades with different outcomes,
      because (strategy, state, trigger) cannot tell two runaway fires at one
      boundary apart. RPT.5 recorded that the write side had never been
      examined; this is that examination.
      · `close_for_trade(trade_id, reason)` — hooked into
        `trade_logger.log_exit`, the ONE choke point every close passes
        through (r154's precedent). Keyed on the TRADE, so it inherits none of
        `link_trade`'s most-recent-live ⟨ASSUMPTION⟩.
      · `close_unfilled(strategy, reason)` — the SECOND leak: a plan that
        fires and is then refused links no trade, so the exit hook can never
        reach it. Called just before the next plan of that strategy opens.
      ⚠️ THE TWO ARE KEPT DISTINCT ON PURPOSE. A filled plan is closed by its
      EXIT and never by supersession; collapsing them would lose the line
      between "fired and lost" and "fired and never filled", which is exactly
      the population this ledger exists to separate.
      🔴 AND "CLOSED" HAD TO JOIN `TERMINAL`. `transition()` sets `closed_ts`
      only for states in that set and `live_plans()` selects on
      `closed_ts IS NULL`, so the first cut wrote rows reading CLOSED that the
      query still returned as live — the state saying one thing and the lookup
      another, silently.
v4.0
Owns `plan_ledger`. INTENT as a first-class record.

v4.0  2026-08-25  See docs/DERIVED_STORES.md.

**A trade is what happened. A plan is what was INTENDED.** They are different
objects and they diverge in ways that matter:

  · A plan can produce NO TRADE AT ALL — the condor decides, sets strikes, and
    the leg trigger never comes. Nothing in `trades` records that a structure
    was designed and never fired. Today that intent evaporates with the
    process.
  · A plan can produce MORE THAN ONE trade — leg 1 and leg 2 are separate rows
    and nothing links them as halves of one structure except convention.
  · A plan HAS A LIFE: DECIDED -> LEG1_FILLED -> COMPLETE, or -> CANCELLED /
    EXPIRED. Same lifecycle shape as the level ledger, same argument for a
    home: recomputation cannot reconstruct a biography.

🔴 THE PROTECTION. `IronCondorStrategy._plan` lives ONLY in memory — zero
persistence in that file. A restart at LEG1_FILLED means ONE LEG IS LIVE AT THE
BROKER AND THE BOT HAS NO MEMORY THAT A SECOND WAS PLANNED. The position
exists; the intent does not. The repo already warns about orphan legs — but
that is detecting the wreckage, not preventing it.

🔴 THE BIGGER PRIZE — MINING THE PLANS THAT NEVER EXECUTED. An unfired plan
still has a KNOWABLE OUTCOME: the market went somewhere. Score it afterwards
and every unfired plan becomes a FREE BACKTEST ON LIVE DATA — no capital, no
slippage, and the strikes were chosen in real time rather than with hindsight.

⚠️ THAT MEASURES THE TRIGGER ITSELF. If unfired plans would have won at the
same rate as fired ones, the trigger is filtering noise. If they would have
done BETTER, the trigger is costing money. That is the question behind Friday
and behind every "why didn't it fire", and it is unanswerable today.

⚠️ THE LEDGER IS THE RECORD, NOT THE AUTHORITY. On reload a plan is restored as
INTENT and must be RE-QUALIFIED against current structure. A plan resumed blind
after a twenty-minute outage is trading a fork that may no longer exist. The
ledger says what we meant; the tape says whether it is still true.

⚠️ WRITES NEVER RAISE. Same rule as every derived home: a bookkeeping failure
must not be able to affect a live position.

# ⚠️ `MISSED` IS ITS OWN STATE AND NOT A FLAVOUR OF `WIPED_BY_RESTART` (r95).
# They are different facts and they cost different things:
#   WIPED_BY_RESTART — the plan was still WAITING on its trigger when the
#       process died. Nothing was lost that the tape can prove; the setup may
#       simply not have happened.
#   MISSED           — the trigger DID fire, on the tape, while we were down.
#       This is a real setup the fleet did not take, and it is the number that
#       answers "what do mid-session deploys and crash-loops actually cost us".
# Collapsing the two would bury the second inside the first, which is exactly
# the plausible-silence class this repo keeps finding.
#
# ⚠️ RECORDED, NEVER RESUMED — operator's ruling, 2026-08-24: "An interrupted
# firing sequence should never attempt a late entry. Log it as missed. But
# normal entries that weren't filled and weren't interrupted should keep
# trying." A MISSED row is a headstone, not a queue.
#
# Terminal reasons. ⚠️ `WIPED_BY_RESTART` IS ITS OWN CATEGORY — on 2026-08-21
# four boxes held confirmed break+retest setups at 10:20-10:24 and the 10:39
# deploy erased them. Folding that into CANCELLED would hide the cost of
# deploying mid-session, which is exactly the number worth knowing.
# 🔴 r212 — "CLOSED" JOINS THE TERMINAL SET, AND ITS ABSENCE WAS HALF THE BUG.
# `transition()` sets `closed_ts` only for a state in here, and `live_plans()`
# selects on `closed_ts IS NULL`. So a plan moved to a state NOT in this set is
# marked and updated and STILL RETURNED AS LIVE — the state says one thing and
# the query says another, silently. That is what the first cut of r212 hit: the
# rows read CLOSED with `closed_ts` NULL and the panel still showed them.
# ⚠️ THE SET IS THE AUTHORITY, NOT THE WORD. Any future terminal state must be
# added here or it will look terminal and behave live.

        been a column since this file was written, `transition()` has accepted
        a `trade_id` argument the whole time, and the append logic is correct —
        and NOTHING IN THE REPO EVER CALLED IT WITH ONE. Measured 2026-08-26:
        863 plans across 15 boxes, ZERO with a trade_id.
        ⚠️ WHAT THAT COSTS IS THE VISION'S ENTIRE METRIC. docs/VISION.md: *"P&L
        and return on risk. Dollars."* Without this link a plan records what it
        EXPECTED and the trade records what it RETURNED, and nothing joins the
        two — so "did TAKE plans make money" is unanswerable, and any R floor
        fitted from declared R alone is the anti-goal that document exists to
        forbid: the engine measured against its own outputs.

        ⚠️ LOOKED UP, NOT THREADED. Plan ids live in three different places
        (`state._orb_plan_id`, `IronCondorStrategy._plan_id`,
        `PlanEngine._declared`), so requiring every call site to pass one is a
        rule the next strategy will forget — the same failure that left the
        sweep on 11:11 and the butterfly on 11:00. Resolving it here means a
        new strategy is linked by existing.

        ⚠️ ⟨ASSUMPTION⟩ MOST-RECENT-LIVE-PLAN-OF-THAT-STRATEGY. When two plans
        of one strategy are live at once — both condor legs — this attaches to
        the newer. That is a heuristic, not a proof, and it is recorded as one:
        a caller holding an exact plan_id should call `transition()` directly.
