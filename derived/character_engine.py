"""
derived/character_engine.py  v4.1
Owns `character_ledger`. Transitions, not per-tick values.

v4.0  2026-08-25  See analysis/character.py for the measurement and the
operator's rulings. This module only decides WHEN a change is real enough to
record, and writes it down.

🔴 THE ACCEPTANCE GATE IS THE OPERATOR'S 20-YEAR PRIOR: **1-3 character changes
per symbol-day.** The retired L2 engine produced ~20/symbol-day, and that
10-20x gap against the same prior is what made its churn visible at all. If
this deriver yields fifteen a day the design is wrong no matter how sensible
the maths looks — check the count before trusting anything downstream.

⚠️ TRANSITIONS ARE THE OBJECT, NOT SAMPLES. A per-tick character value would
be ~1,560 rows per symbol-day saying almost nothing. What is worth knowing is
that the tape CHANGED, when, and what it changed from. The raw axes stay at
full resolution in the row so a study can see how close the call was.

⚠️ A CHARACTER THAT HELD ALL SESSION AND ONE THAT FLIPPED SIX TIMES ARE
DIFFERENT SESSIONS — operator's point, and the reason the ledger stores
`held_s` on the row that closes.

⚠️ ADX AND ATR ARE RECORDED PARALLEL, NOT FED IN. See analysis/character.py.
They are on the row so a study can ask whether they agree; blending them would
make agreement true by construction.
