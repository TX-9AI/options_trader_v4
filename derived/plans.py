derived/plans.py  v2.0
v2.0  2026-08-26  r146 — THE SEVEN BUILDERS ARE DELETED (1,212 lines, lines
      465-1677 of v1.0). They were a second implementation of every strategy
      that guessed at what the real one would do and recorded the guess; zero
      of seven called the strategy they described, and the table read
      `TrendParticipation | TAKE | R 1.43` across the fleet on 2026-08-26
      while those boxes traded nothing. Operator: *"I don't need two
      strategies for every strategy."* Full accounting in
      docs/HANDOFF_PLAN_ARCHITECTURE_REBUILD.md.
      WHAT MOVED WHERE: the recording layer (plan_tick / plan_check schema,
      NULL-not-zero, starved rows) -> `strategy/plan.py`; the shared session
      map and the operator's geometry ruling -> `analysis/session_map.py`;
      the R hurdle stays in `strategy/criteria.py`. This file is now the
      BOARD: it advances the tick clock and closes each tick with a row for
      every strategy the dispatch did not ask, carrying the dispatcher's own
      reason. It computes nothing about any trade.
v1.0  2026-08-25  r126 — forward plans, declared, priced and recorded.

THE BOARD — one row per strategy per tick, no exceptions.

The strategies write their own rows now (`strategy/plan.py`). What they
cannot write is the row for a tick in which they were NEVER CALLED — ORB
before its engine confirms, the runaway when the ORB has not run away, every
credit strategy when a debit strategy already claimed the slot. Those
silences were the ambiguity that cost the 2026-08-26 session: "ORB did not
set up" and "ORB was never asked" were the same absence.

`derive()` runs at the END of `assemble_market_state` — the one assembly
point — so it sees every tick exactly once:
  1. `close_tick()` — for the tick that just finished, write NOT ASKED rows
     for any registered strategy that wrote nothing, using the reason
     `main.py` gave through `plan.skipped()`. A strategy that WAS asked and
     still wrote nothing gets a NO PLAN row that says so — that is the canary
     for an unwired `return None`, and it goes to the log at WARNING.
  2. `begin_tick()` — advance the shared tick clock so every strategy's row
     this tick carries the same ts.
  3. The board line to the log at INFO, every PLAN_BOARD_LOG_S seconds.

⚠️ OBSERVE-ONLY, STILL. This engine reads nothing a strategy decides on and
writes nothing a strategy reads. The plan's verdict is consulted INSIDE the
strategy, through `strategy/plan.py`; the board only guarantees the record
is complete.
