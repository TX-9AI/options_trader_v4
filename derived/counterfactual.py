derived/counterfactual.py  v4.0
Owns `exit_counterfactual`. Records what a FLOW exit WOULD have done.

v4.0  2026-08-25  Operator's question: could the tape — especially aggressor
flow building — inform an exit better than a mechanical stop? The condor
specifically, possibly the sweep and directional credit spreads too.

🔴 THE ANSWER IS "MEASURE IT", AND THIS REPO HAS PAID ONCE FOR NOT DOING SO.
`bos_exit` — exit on a structural signal instead of a mechanical level —
measured **34% win / 217 trades / -$7,085, with the largest single loss in the
v3 book**, against `orb_trail_stop` at **96% / 85 / +$30,696**. BOS is the same
IDEA and it lost badly when measured. The instinct may still be right; the
burden of proof is high and must be paid in data.

⚠️ THIS MODULE NEVER EXITS ANYTHING. It evaluates the flow condition on every
tick a position is open and writes down WHEN IT WOULD HAVE FIRED. The
mechanical stop runs untouched. After some weeks the same trades carry two exit
policies — one real, one hypothetical — against real outcomes.

⚠️ WHY THE ARGUMENT IS PLAUSIBLE: a mechanical stop on a credit structure is a
PREMIUM stop, and premium is a lagging, noisy proxy for what actually hurts
you. On a four-legged condor the mark is the sum of four spreads, each with its
own staleness and width. Aggressor flow into the short strike is the DAMAGE
MECHANISM ITSELF, observed as it happens. The stop waits for the consequence;
the flow is the cause.

⚠️ AND IT IS STILL CONFIRMATORY. Sellers lifting through the short strike right
now is evidence, not forecast.

⚠️ THE FAILURE MODE UNDER TEST, which is BOS's failure mode: the condor's edge
is a high win rate from DOING NOTHING. An exit that fires on flow that does not
follow through converts winners into small losses, and it takes many avoided
disasters to pay for that. Flow is noisy at exactly this timescale.
