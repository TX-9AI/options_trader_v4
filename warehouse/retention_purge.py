warehouse/retention_purge.py  v1.3
v1.3  2026-09-05  r256 — TWO PURGES FOUGHT OVER ONE DATABASE, AND THIS FILE HAD
      NO LOCK WHILE ITS SIBLING HAS HAD ONE ALL ALONG.
      🔴 MEASURED ON THE FLEET, 2026-09-05, NOT REASONED. The conductor's purge
      phase and a hand-run `--apply` fan-out overlapped, and four boxes died
      with `sqlite3.OperationalError: database is locked` at
      `DELETE FROM candles`. `s3_push.acquire_lock()` has guarded EVERY
      invocation path since WH.6 for exactly this reason — *"the timer and the
      conductor's --verify are different entrypoints to the same work, and
      nothing else was stopping them overlapping"* — and this file, which
      DELETES, had nothing. Same idiom, same `LOCK_WAIT` shape, one lock file.
      🔴 AND `_open()` CONNECTED AT SQLITE'S 5-SECOND DEFAULT. A 2 GB delete
      runs far longer than that, so a brief overlap RAISED instead of waiting.
      `busy_timeout` is now explicit and generous; the lock makes contention
      rare and the timeout makes the rare case wait rather than fail.
      🔴 AND ONE LOCKED TABLE KILLED THE WHOLE RUN. The COUNT was wrapped and
      the DELETE was not, so an error on `candles` escaped `purge()`, took
      `main()` with it, and the RECLAIM NEVER EXECUTED — which is why AMD,
      AVGO, GOOGL and NVDA kept their WALs while the boxes that got through
      returned 8.7 GB. Each DELETE is now guarded per table: it reports, it
      counts the failure, and the run continues to the checkpoint.
      ⚠️ A PARTIAL PURGE IS SAID OUT LOUD. Tables that could not be trimmed are
      named in the summary and the exit code is non-zero, because "removed
      1,452 rows" and "removed 1,452 rows and failed on four tables" are
      different facts and only one of them needs an operator.
      🔑 WHAT TONIGHT PROVED, RECORDED SO IT IS NOT RE-LITIGATED: the reclaim
      itself WORKS. QQQ's WAL went 1.7 GB -> 260 KB and its store 2.4 GB ->
      1.4 GB; TSLA 1.1 GB -> 268 KB and 1.9 GB -> 1020 MB, on a re-run with
      nobody else touching the box. Fleet 23.2 GB -> 9.8 GB. The design was
      right; it had no mutual exclusion.
v1.2  2026-09-05  r255 — TRANSFER, DELETE, **RECLAIM** — AND FOUR STORES THAT
      GREW UNBOUNDED BY ABSENCE FROM EVERY LIST RATHER THAN BY POLICY.
      Operator, 2026-09-05: *"Transfer to s3, then delete, then vacuum. We need
      a nightly hygiene program that aggressively scrubs the boxes after the
      session & leaves only the required tenors."*

      🔴 DELETING ROWS RETURNED NO DISK, AND THIS PROJECT WROTE THAT DOWN
      ITSELF. `purge_verified`'s docstring reads *"NO VACUUM ... SQLite reuses
      freed pages and the store reaches steady state."* Steady state is a
      PLATEAU AT THE HIGH-WATER MARK, not a shrink. Measured fleet-wide
      2026-09-05: `feed_store.db` carries 18-34% free pages — 330-690 MB per
      box, inside files this purge has trimmed nightly since r162. The purge was
      working and the space was never coming back.

      🔴 AND THE WAL WAS LARGER THAN ANYTHING THE PURGE COULD REACH. MU held a
      **1.6 GB `feed_store.db-wal`** beside a 2.3 GB database; META 1.1 GB, AMD
      963 MB, AVGO 596 MB, CRM 500 MB. ⚠️ A WAL IS NOT RECLAIMED BY VACUUM — it
      is reclaimed by a CHECKPOINT, which costs seconds and no temp space, so it
      runs FIRST and unconditionally. SQLite auto-checkpoints near 4 MB, so a
      1.6 GB WAL means checkpoints have not been completing, and the checkpoint
      result is REPORTED rather than assumed: a TRUNCATE blocked by a live
      reader returns busy and looks exactly like one that worked.
      ⚠️ THE WAL WAS INVISIBLE FOR AN HOUR BECAUSE THE MEASUREMENT GLOBBED
      `*.db`. WORKING_AGREEMENT §0.3 records that exact incident — the WAL files
      are `.db-wal`, and the biggest files on the box were excluded by the
      pattern whose job was to find them.

      🔴 VACUUM IS GATED, NOT ATTEMPTED. It writes a COMPLETE SECOND COPY before
      replacing the original, so it needs free disk greater than the live size —
      and on 2026-09-05 the four boxes that needed it most (MU, NVDA, TSLA and
      META, all under 900 MB free) are exactly the four where it would have
      failed. A VACUUM that dies half-way at 16:10 on a 96%-full box is worse
      than no VACUUM. It refuses with the arithmetic printed, and `SQLITE_TMPDIR`
      points at the data directory because `/tmp` is a 476 MB tmpfs and a 1.8 GB
      rewrite cannot fit in it (learned on MU, NVDA and QQQ, 2026-08-27).

      🔑 FOUR STORES GREW BY ABSENCE. `plan_tick`, `plan_check`, `shadow` and
      `chain_snapshots` appear in NONE of `RETENTION_DAYS`, `ARTIFACT_DAYS`,
      `DERIVED_ARTIFACT_DAYS` or `NEVER_PURGE` — nothing deleted them and
      nothing protected them either.
      ⚠️ `chain_snapshots` IS THE SHARPEST: `config.py` has DECLARED 3 days for
      it since v4.4 and no code ever read that. This file's own header rule says
      config is the document and this is the code, so this file moves.
      ⚠️ AND THEY NEEDED SEPARATE LISTS RATHER THAN A BIGGER ONE.
      `check_purge_pushed` C9 proves every `DERIVED_ARTIFACT_DAYS` table ships
      via `push_series`; `plan_tick`/`plan_check` ship via `push_derived` (CDC)
      and the trees via `push_jsonl_tree`/`_push_chain_tree`. Adding them to the
      existing dict would have turned C9 red FOR A TRUE REASON and taught the
      next reader to loosen the one check that caught r191.

      🔴 `shadow` IS DECLARED AND NOT ENFORCED (`None`), AND THAT IS WHY IT
      SHIPS TODAY AT ALL. The 2026-08-25 purge deleted 492,945 `raw/shadow`
      objects believing the stream was dead. It is not: 15/15 boxes carry a live
      unit and 17-32 date directories reaching back to 2026-07-21, and because
      `push_jsonl_tree` resumes from a per-path offset the bucket was never
      re-sent. **The boxes hold the only copy of everything before 08-26, so
      arming shadow before that history is re-pushed and VERIFIED would destroy
      it.** Same sequencing the operator set for the tenors in r80: write the
      number down, argue with it, then give it a consumer.

      ⚠️ IT NOW REPORTS WHAT REMAINS, NOT ONLY WHAT WENT. Aggression has to be
      aimed, and no deletion count explains why MU holds 1.8 GB live against
      CVX's 0.20 GB on identical policy. Per-table remaining rows print every
      run, so the next tuning decision is a query rather than an argument.
v1.1  2026-08-29
v1.1  2026-08-29  r191 — THE DERIVED-SERIES PURGE LIST BECOMES A CONSTANT,
      and its justification is retired. Behaviour is unchanged: the same
      three tables, the same 20 days. What changes is that
      `DERIVED_ARTIFACT_DAYS` is importable, so `check_purge_pushed` can see
      it — which is why it never noticed that all three were being deleted
      with no push stage. See the block above `purge()`'s derived loop for
      why "pure functions of the candles" does not hold, especially for
      `surface_series`.
Trim expired LOCAL data. Dry by default. Never runs unless S3 verified first.

v1.0  2026-08-25  Enforces the policy declared inert in `config.py` v4.4
(RETENTION_DAYS / RETENTION_DAYS_ARTIFACTS). Operator's sequencing:
**"We need to write the per tenor retain before writing any kind of per-tenor
purge"** — the numbers were written down first, argued with, and only then
given a consumer.

🔑 IT RUNS INSIDE `self_close`, AFTER VERIFICATION, NOT ON ITS OWN TIMER.
Two reasons, and the second is the important one:
  · The fleet just went from six EOD timers to two. Adding a third undoes that.
  · **self_close purges at the one moment verification has JUST SUCCEEDED.**
    The rule "never delete unverified data" then falls out of the ORDERING
    rather than needing its own check — if the drain came back SHORT the box
    holds up and this is never reached.

🔑 DAILY, NOT ONE-TIME. A one-shot script has to catch up on ~40 days of
accumulation in a single pass — the largest and riskiest deletion this system
would ever run. A daily pass removes one day's worth and stays boring forever.

🔴 DRY BY DEFAULT. `OT_RETENTION_APPLY=1` arms it. **The policy numbers are
ARITHMETIC FROM EMA_ANCHOR=200, NOT MEASUREMENTS** — 200 bars converted to days
per tenor. Running dry for a week costs nothing and says whether 60 days of 1h
is right or whether the fork (which needs only 21 bars) makes it far too
generous.

⚠️ THE LIFECYCLE TABLES ARE EXCLUDED IN CODE, NOT IN CONFIG. character_ledger,
plan_ledger, gate_disposition, strategy_note and fire_snapshot record STATE
TRANSITIONS AS THEY HAPPENED — a recomputation cannot reconstruct a biography,
so they are as unrecoverable as the tape itself. Indicators, forks and surface
ARE pure functions of the candles and are the safe ones to trim. A hard-coded
exclusion cannot be switched off by a config edit.

⚠️ IT REPORTS WHAT IT REMOVED, ALWAYS. A silent purge is how a wrong threshold
is discovered three weeks later, when the data it took is gone.
