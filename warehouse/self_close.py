warehouse/self_close.py  v1.3
The box closes ITSELF: drain to S3, verify it landed, then shut down.

v1.3  2026-09-05  r255 — RELEASE THE STORES BEFORE THE RECLAIM. `retention_purge`
now checkpoints and vacuums, and both are blocked by a live connection:
`wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)` returns busy while any other connection holds a read
mark, and the WAL is only partly reclaimed (measured, check_purge_reclaim
R2/R2b: 7.1MB -> 4.4MB with a reader, 7.1MB -> 0 without). MU carried a 1.6 GB
`feed_store.db-wal` beside a 2.3 GB store on 2026-09-05.
⚠️ AS A NEW STEP 2b, NOT BY CHANGING STEP 1. v1.2 leaves the feed running "so a
16:00 candle can still land" and that is still right for the DRAIN — the feed
writes right through it. What changed is that something now runs AFTER the
drain which the feed can block, so the stop belongs after verification has
SUCCEEDED. A held box returns before this line and keeps its feed exactly as it
did.
⚠️ STOP, NEVER DISABLE, and it never blocks the halt — a failed stop is logged
and the purge simply reclaims less, which the checkpoint then reports as BUSY
rather than as success.

v1.2  2026-08-23  AUDIT F1: THE VERIFIER WAS SPAWNED UNDER THE BOT VENV, WHICH
HAS NO boto3. The unit runs this file under `venv/bin/python` and v1.1 passed
`sys.executable` on to `s3_push.py`, whose late `import boto3` then raised
inside its rule-1 handler: it printed "run aborted, nothing confirmed", exited
0, and there was no DRAIN line. That parses as SHORT -> every box stayed up and
paged, every night, and the purge never ran. `deploy/s3-push.service` and
`install_s3_push_timer.sh` both state the constraint ("boto3 is present in
SYSTEM python fleet-wide and absent from the bot venv"); this file did not
carry it across. The verifier now runs under the SAME interpreter the s3-push
unit uses (`/usr/bin/python3`), so the two paths cannot disagree about the
environment either. Fail direction unchanged: a verifier that cannot run
still reads as unverified and the box stays up. Also: a verifier TIMEOUT
(`subprocess.TimeoutExpired`) was an uncaught raise - box held with no alert.
It is now held AND alerted like any other unverified close.

v1.1  2026-08-25  Runs the RETENTION PURGE after verification and before the
halt. Placed there deliberately: the purge must never touch unverified data,
and a held box never reaches that line, so the guarantee falls out of the
ordering rather than needing its own check. Dry unless OT_RETENTION_APPLY=1.

v1.0  2026-08-25  Operator's design, and it is a better architecture than the
control-only one it replaces:

  *"There should be a timer on the boxes that has them push to s3 if they are
   still awake after a certain time from market close. Rationale: they don't
   need to know they're controlled. If control is disabled, or not used, they
   push to s3 at a particular time, verify data landed & shut down. And if the
   box is down when the timer fires because conductor already did everything,
   then it fires into silence. Nothing happens. No warning. Just nothing
   needed."*

🔑 THE BOX'S AUTONOMY IS THE FALLBACK, NOT A COMPETING SYSTEM. Every box is
independently correct on its own. The conductor is an OPTIMISATION — it closes
the fleet sooner and in a coordinated order — and when it has already run, this
timer fires on a stopped machine and nothing happens. **A timer firing into
silence is the CORRECT outcome here, not a missed run**, so it must never warn.

🔴 IT INVERTS THE FAILURE MODE, WHICH IS THE REAL WIN. Before: control disabled
or broken meant fifteen boxes RAN ALL NIGHT and the operator found out from the
bill. Now a dead control server costs nothing — the fleet closes itself.

⚠️ 16:45 IS CHOSEN SO THE TWO CAN NEVER RACE. The conductor starts at 16:05 and
has the boxes down by ~16:08. A tighter gap risks both draining at once — two
writers on the same prefixes, which is precisely the collision class behind the
duplicate objects in the bucket.

⚠️ VERIFY BEFORE HALT, ALWAYS — and STAY UP IF SHORT. A box that shuts down on
unverified data is worse than one that stays up: the local store is the only
copy left, and a stopped box cannot be asked anything.

⚠️ AND A HELD BOX HAS NO ONE TO TELL, so it alerts for itself. The conductor
reports held boxes to the operator; autonomy does not give that for free, and a
box that quietly stays up short is a box nobody looks at until morning.
