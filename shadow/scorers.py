shadow/scorers.py  v4.1
v4.1  2026-08-25  r65 EXORCISM: every mention of the retired classification
      system removed - identifiers, comments, docstrings, schema. The word
      does not appear in this tree. Full accounting: REMOVAL_LOG (delivery).

Post-mortem scoring surface for observed entries.

v4.0  2026-08-19  Ported from options_trader_v3 at the OTV4 split.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
Dated release framing and trivia are stripped; what remains is the
reasoning behind the thresholds, the design guarantees, and the
defects that recur when forgotten. WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires
this block be read before the file is edited.

shadow/scorers.py — per-pattern conviction scorers (shadow: sweep-reversal first).
initial release.
Each pattern owns its own completeness checklist and composes registry
conjunctions into a 0->1 conviction score. Different patterns are different
recipes over the SAME primitives.
SweepReversalPrecursorScorer models the reversal as a staged sequence:
    APPROACH -> THRUST -> EXHAUSTION -> REJECTION -> RECLAIM
  conviction = (weighted sum of assembled stages) x coherence multiplier
  - coherence: stages arriving IN ORDER and CLOSE IN TIME reinforce;
    scattered / out-of-order / stale pieces don't.
  - decay: completed stages expire (STAGE_TTL_S) as a forming setup goes stale.
  - invalidation collapse: ACCEPTANCE through the level (clean_break) means
    it's a breakout, not a reversal ==> full reset.
  None  -> ineligible: no named level within range; the pattern CANNOT form here
  0.0   -> eligible: the pattern COULD form here, nothing has assembled yet
These are logged distinctly (null vs 0) — they mean different things.
