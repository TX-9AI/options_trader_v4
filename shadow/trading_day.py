"""
shadow/trading_day.py  v4.0
Session-boundary helper for the observer.

v4.0  2026-08-19  Ported from options_trader_v3 at the OTV4 split.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
Dated release framing and trivia are stripped; what remains is the
reasoning behind the thresholds, the design guarantees, and the
defects that recur when forgotten. WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires
this block be read before the file is edited.

shadow/trading_day.py v1.0 — standalone US-market trading-day check.
Self-contained (stdlib only, no shadow/* imports) so it can run as a plain
script from a systemd ExecCondition. Exits 0 on a trading day, 1 on a
weekend or US market holiday — the start service uses that to SKIP (not fail)
on holidays. Evaluates the date in ET regardless of the box's system timezone.
⚠ Holiday list is hardcoded and must be refreshed annually (2026–2027 below).
Fail-safe: a wrong 'holiday' just means shadow doesn't observe that day (no harm);
a missed holiday means it observes an empty tape (harmless noise), never a trade.
