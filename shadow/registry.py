shadow/registry.py  v4.1
v4.1  2026-08-25  r65 EXORCISM: every mention of the retired classification
      system removed - identifiers, comments, docstrings, schema. The word
      does not appear in this tree. Full accounting: REMOVAL_LOG (delivery).

Registry of shadow primitives and their gates.

v4.0  2026-08-19  Ported from options_trader_v3 at the OTV4 split.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
Dated release framing and trivia are stripped; what remains is the
reasoning behind the thresholds, the design guarantees, and the
defects that recur when forgotten. WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires
this block be read before the file is edited.

shadow/registry.py — registry of named "completeness" conjunctions.
initial release.
A PASSIVE library of reusable sub-checks over the shared primitives. Always
available; every scorer reads it independently and composes its own recipe.
would reintroduce the late-entry chicken-and-egg.
Every function is pure: (Primitives, [LiquidityMap]) -> bool / small struct.
Calibration constants are placeholders to be tightened from shadow sessions.
