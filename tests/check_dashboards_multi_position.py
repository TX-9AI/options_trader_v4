"""tests/check_dashboards_multi_position.py  v1.1
v1.1  2026-09-01  r211 — D3/D4/D5 RE-DERIVED. Chunk C reduced status.py's
      open-position block to a bare count on the operator's ruling, so
      asserting BOTH files carry the summed exposure was asserting a
      DUPLICATE. r199's real invariant — the figure a reader checks must be
      the BOX's, never one position's — is unchanged and now pinned once, in
      query.py, plus a new D3b refusing any per-position exposure line in
      status.py at all.
      ⚠️ D3b IS ANCHORED ON `print()` CALLS, not on the file text: the first
      draft matched the module docstring and a comment, both of which describe
      the r199 defect while explaining it (§20, and rule 5 makes that prose
      mandatory).
BOTH DASHBOARDS SHOW EVERY OPEN POSITION, AND THE EXPOSURE THEY PRINT IS THE
BOX'S — NOT ONE ROW'S.

v1.0  2026-08-31  r199 — born red at r198: both readers carry
      `ORDER BY entry_time DESC LIMIT 1`.

🔴 THE DEFECT WAS LATENT FOR FOUR DAYS AND BECOMES NORMAL TOMORROW. Before r161
made the butterfly additive, one position per box was TRUE and `LIMIT 1` was
correct. r161 changed the rule and nothing swept the readers. Measured
2026-08-31 on CRM, which held a runaway AND a butterfly and reported one — with
`Contracts: 2 × $100 = $1010.00 at risk` describing the runaway alone while the
butterfly's capital went unmentioned. r197 makes multi-position boxes the norm.

🔑 D3 IS THE CHECK THAT MATTERS, AND IT IS NOT ABOUT ROW COUNT. A dashboard
that lists two positions and still prints one position's exposure recreates
exactly the confusion r121 fixed ("How is 2 contracts at $96 costing me
$800???"), one level up. The summed figure is the number a person acts on.

⚠️ D5 PINS THE SORT. `DESC` put the newest on top and hid the position that had
been running longest — usually the one worth seeing. Oldest first is a
deliberate choice, not an accident of rewriting the query.
