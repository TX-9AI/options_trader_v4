tests/check_gex_from_chains.py  v2.0
v2.0  2026-09-20  r395 / GEX.2 — REWRITTEN FOR THE ADAPTER. v1.0 gated a LOCAL
      `gex_profile()` that v3.0 DELETED, because that function was a SECOND
      DEFINITION of `data/gex_data.py`: the scalar differed by spot/100 and
      the OI differed IN KIND. A gate left pointing at removed machinery fails
      on an AttributeError and reads as breakage rather than as a design
      change — the same reason check_wargame was rewritten at r393 rather
      than left to rot.
v1.0  2026-09-19  r391 / GEX.1 — THE INSTRUMENT THE GAMMA HYPOTHESIS WOULD
      HAVE LEANED ON WAS RETURNING CONFIDENT NOTHING.

🔴 BORN FROM A MEASUREMENT, NOT A WORRY. `gex_from_chains` v1.0 globbed
`/home/claude/cc` — a path from ANOTHER MACHINE — got zero files, and printed
"NO GAMMA FLIP FOUND IN ANY SNAPSHOT ... that is a REAL answer, not a missing
one" with exit code 0. It asserted its own absence was the tape's answer,
which is r39 exactly inverted, and it is the third ungated analysis tool found
doing this in one day ([[CHK.8]], [[RPL.1]]).

G1  an absent/empty load REFUSES BY NAME and exits NON-ZERO
G2  the refusal reaches for the WAREHOUSE, not a local directory
G3  a real load produces a real profile (gamma x OI, signed)
G4  the conclusion block is UNREACHABLE on an empty set
G5  "no pin" carries the n it rests on
G6  the unverified dealer-sign ASSUMPTION is still declared to the reader
