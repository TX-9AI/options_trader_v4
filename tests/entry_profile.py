tests/entry_profile.py  v4.0
What did a GOOD entry look like? Profile contrast and the wants list.

v4.0  2026-08-19  Built at the OTV4 split. ROADMAP Phase 1.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires this block be read before the file is edited.

THE QUESTION, AND WHY IT IS NOT "WHICH FEATURE SEPARATES".
"Does feature X separate?" produces a ranked list of weak correlations and
invites a threshold on the best one. **That is exactly what v3 did with the
setup scorer, and it inverted**: A-grade 399 trades -$8,244 at 1.5x size against
B-grade 220 trades +$1,893.

This asks instead: what did the tape LOOK LIKE at entry on the trades that
worked? The output is a PROFILE CONTRAST plus a WANTS LIST - conditions that
hold more often on good entries than bad - because a trigger modelled on a
picture fires when the picture matches, not when one number clears a bar. A want
that is individually weak still earns its place if it shows up reliably; a
single-threshold gate would have thrown it away.

THE LABEL: DIRECTIONAL CORRECTNESS, NOT P&L.
Three different things were being blurred and the operator separated them:
  DIRECTIONALLY CORRECT  did the underlying move the way the trade pointed.
                         Pure entry quality. No option mechanics, no management.
  EVER REACHED x% (MFE)  entry quality PLUS option mechanics. A directionally
                         correct trade can still fail to reach x% if theta or
                         the spread ate the move.
  REALISED P&L           stops and management. **Those are the parts that
                         already work** (orb_trail_stop 95% / 107 / +$37,848;
                         theta_bleed 100% / 107) and measuring an ENTRY against
                         them credits or blames it for something downstream.
Primary label is DIRECTION. MFE is secondary. **Where the two disagree - right
direction, never reached x% - that is its own population**, and it is a friction
or strike-selection finding, not an entry finding.

WHY THE v3 SAMPLE IS GOOD FOR THIS, which is counter-intuitive.
The classifier that chose these entries picked the correct side on 44.9% of 715
trades (95% CI [41.3%, 48.6%]) - **worse than a coin**. A near-random sampler is
close to IDEAL for mining: the favourable trades are not "cases where the engine
was right", they are **cases where the structure was good enough to work
anyway**. The failures are an equally broad sample of what does not.

⚠️ THE RESIDUAL BIAS, STATED. The engine still chose WHEN AND WHERE to look, so
coverage is biased even though direction was noise. **A mined want needs forward
validation before it sizes anything.**

⚠️ AND AN AMBIENT CONDITION IS NOT A WANT. A condition holding on 95% of good
entries and 93% of bad ones is not characteristic of good entries - it is what
the tape usually does. The wants list reports BOTH rates and the lift, so
ambient conditions are visible rather than mistaken for signal.
