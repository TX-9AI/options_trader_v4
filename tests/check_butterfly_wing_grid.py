"""tests/check_butterfly_wing_grid.py  v1.1
v1.1  2026-09-01  r208 — W2/W3/W7 RE-DERIVED AGAINST THE SEARCH. The wing is
      no longer computed from WING_EM_FRAC and snapped to a grid, so W2/W3
      re-implemented arithmetic that no longer exists (C.23: a test that
      re-implements the thing it measures tests itself). They now DRIVE
      generate_signal on the PLTR 2.50 ladder that broke r198 and assert the
      selected legs are LISTED and symmetric about an unmoved pin — which is
      the invariant r198 was really about. W7's stretch pin is retired: with
      the wing searched, `wing_stretch` is always None and the old assertion
      still PASSED while measuring a quantity that can no longer vary.
      W1/W4/W5/W6 stand — `_chain_increment` survives for REPORTING.
THE BUTTERFLY'S WINGS SIT ON STRIKES THAT ACTUALLY EXIST.

v1.0  2026-08-31  r198 — born red at r197: `_chain_increment` does not exist
      there, and the wing is quantised by `config.STRIKE_INCREMENT` through
      `round_to_strike()`, which returns an **int**.

🔴 THE FAILURE THIS PINS, measured on the first live-fleet session. One global
increment for fifteen symbols, and an int-returning rounder:
    PLTR  pin 190,   EM 3.25 -> wing 1 -> legs 189 / 191   ($2.50 ladder)
    AMD   pin 472.5          -> wing 1 -> legs 470.5 / 474.5
Neither pair is listed, so `_exact()` refused — correctly — for **242 and 243
minutes**, roughly 900 ticks each, on both boxes, all session. An arithmetic
problem wearing the costume of a market judgement.

🔑 W3 IS THE CHECK THAT KEEPS THE DOCTRINE. The apex is the trade, and *"a
nearest-strike substitute is a different one"*. Both pins above were LISTED
strikes — only the wings were off-grid. So this must snap the WINGS and never
the apex, and W3 asserts the apex is exactly the pin after snapping.

⚠️ W5 GUARDS THE MEDIAN. A single stray half-strike in a $2.50 ladder would
set a min-based grid to 0.50 and reproduce the bug for that symbol on that day.

    # is now SEARCHED over the chain's own strikes — and a test that
    # re-implements the thing it measures tests itself (C.23, the r181 sizing
    # checker that was green for two days over a dead field). These now drive
    # the real `generate_signal` on a PLTR-shaped 2.50 ladder.
    # ⚠️ AND THIS IS THE INVARIANT THE OPERATOR ASKED ABOUT: r198's failure was
    # compute-a-wing-then-DEMAND-it, so an unlisted wing refused the trade for
    # 242 minutes. The search cannot do that — a wing is only a candidate
    # because both legs came back priced — and W2 pins exactly that.
