"""check_conviction_removed.py — v2.0

🔴 THE SETUP SCORER IS DELETED. NO GRADE, NO CONVICTION, NO WEIGHTED SUM.

Operator, 2026-08-27: *"What fucking SUM are we still using??? That is TRASH
CODE. It's held over dumpster fodder from otv3 which was a complete failure."*
And: *"Get the grading bullshit out of there. If we re-introduce it later, it
won't be anything resembling the previous model."*

WHAT IT WAS: four dimensions x weights, summed to a `total`, compared against a
threshold to emit an A/B letter or REFUSE the trade.

WHY IT IS GONE — docs/INHERITED_FINDINGS.md §4, measured:
  **A-grade 399 trades −$8,244 · B-grade 220 trades +$1,893.**
It SELECTED LOSERS. ~90% of the grade was ONE COLUMN PRINTED TWICE
(`regime_conviction` and `signal_quality`, identical medians AND identical
spreads over 619 trades) plus two constants measuring 1.000 across all 619 —
and those constants were `vwap_alignment` and `liquidity_clear`, two of the
four dimensions. The sum never measured anything.

⚠️ BY 2026-08-27 IT CONTRIBUTED NOTHING BUT REFUSALS. Both of its named gates
were default-OFF (`MIN_RRR_ACTIVE=0`, `VWAP_FILTER_ACTIVE=0`), and
`signal.conviction` defaulted to 0.0 with exactly ONE strategy of seven ever
setting it — so five strategies were capped at 0.75 of the score permanently.
TSLA's runaway scored vwap 1.0 / liquidity 1.0 / rrr 1.0 / macro 0.8, totalled
**0.43 against a 0.55 floor**, and was refused while the whole fleet sat at
zero trades through the highest-volume half hour of the day.

⚠️ AND THE PROFILES WERE ARITHMETICALLY BROKEN besides: weights were removed
over time and the remainder never rescaled. ContinuationStrategy topped out at
0.450 against a 0.55 floor — mathematically unable to pass on any tape — while
owning the best measured exit in the fleet (continuation_trail, 149 trades,
85%, +$27,884).

THE VETOES THAT REMAIN ARE THE OPERATOR'S, AND THEY LIVE IN THE STRATEGIES:
the R hurdle (muted under relaxed), session-map geometry, entry windows, level
invalidation, distance-to-pin. A setup either meets its own spec or it does
not. There is no second opinion summed from weights nobody chose.

⚠️ WHAT MUST SURVIVE: `TrendVote.conviction` (analysis/trend_engine.py) is
computed fresh from ADX and EMA alignment on every call — a per-timeframe vote
weight, NOT the leaky integrator. `ScoreResult.conviction` (shadow/) is the
shadow scorer's own output, log-only by design. Three different things share
the name; only one was dead.
