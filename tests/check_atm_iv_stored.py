"""tests/check_atm_iv_stored.py  v1.0
`atm_iv` REACHES ctx, AND EVERY READER TAKES THE SAME VALUE.

v1.0  2026-08-31  r205 — born red at r204: `ctx["atm_iv"]` is never assigned.

🔴 MEASURED, NOT REASONED. Every one of the 31 `fire_snapshot` rows from the
fleet's first live session (2026-08-31) carried `price` and a NULL `atm_iv`,
across all 13 symbols that fired. `chain.atm_iv` is a real property
(options_chain.py:175, r177) and `chain` is a PARAMETER of `run_analysis` — but
the only two readers bound it to a LOCAL `_atm_iv` inside the butterfly
dispatch branches. A grep for any assignment to `ctx["atm_iv"]` came back
empty, so `ctx.setdefault("atm_iv", None)` was the first and last word on it.

⚠️ THE SNAPSHOT WAS THE SYMPTOM. `ctx["atm_iv"]` feeds
`volatility_measures.summarise(...)`, which produces `expected_move_iv` and
`variance_risk_premium`. Those have been derived from None since they were
written — and the comment above that call says the decay term is the whole
point of passing a live IV.

🔑 A2 IS THE CHECK THAT MATTERS, AND IT EXECUTES. `run_analysis` needs live
market data and raises in a sandbox, so the conversion is extracted as
`atm_iv_from_chain` and pinned directly — a check that can only report "could
not execute" gates nothing. A3 pins that
the butterfly branches read the STORED value rather than recomputing, because
two computations of one quantity in one tick can disagree — the bug nobody
would ever find.

⚠️ A4 pins that a MISSING chain leaves the field None rather than 0.0. Absent
and zero are different facts, and r177 exists because a `getattr(..., 0.0)`
default masked exactly this absence for months.
