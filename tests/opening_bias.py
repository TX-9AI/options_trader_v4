tests/opening_bias.py  v4.0
Does the session OPENING expose a directional bias for the rest of the day?

v4.0  2026-08-19  Built at the OTV4 split. ROADMAP Phase 1.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires this block be read before the file is edited.

WHY THIS QUESTION IS DIFFERENT FROM EVERY OTHER ENTRY TEST SO FAR.
Every condition measured up to now was read AT THE MOMENT OF ENTRY, and every
one of them came back ambient - ADX > 30 held on 91% of good ContinuationStrategy
entries and 88% of bad ones. **That is not a weak signal; it is a PRE-FILTERED
population.** ADX > 30 is continuation's own gate, so every trade in the sample
had already cleared it. A condition cannot be measured on a population it
selected.

The opening candle cannot be pre-filtered. It is fixed by 09:45, it is a
property of the SESSION rather than of any entry, and no strategy had a say in
it. Every trade that day inherits the same value regardless of when it fired.
**It is the first genuinely independent variable in this investigation.**

AND IT IS ASKED OF THE TAPE, NOT OF THE TRADE BOOK. The trades cover 13 sessions
and 366 rows filtered by a broken engine. The tape covers every session and every
symbol collected - no strategy chose any of it.

⚠️ TWO OUTCOMES ARE MEASURED, DELIBERATELY.
  CLOSE      did the session close in the same direction. Blunt: a day that
             opens green, runs 1% and closes flat-red counts as a miss and was
             tradeable all morning.
  EXCURSION  was the day's LARGER excursion in that direction. Closer to what a
             directional bias is actually FOR - it asks whether the side was
             right, not whether the settle agreed.
Reporting only the first would understate a real bias; reporting only the second
would flatter one.

⚠️ SESSIONS ARE THE SAMPLE, NOT TRADES. Twenty trades on one trending day are
one observation, not twenty. Everything here counts (session, symbol) once.

    """What happened AFTER the opening window closed. The tradeable part.

    ⚠️ THE INCLUSIVE MEASURE IS PARTLY TAUTOLOGICAL AND THE FIRST VERSION OF
    THIS TOOL SHIPPED IT AS A FINDING. `up_excursion` asked whether the day's
    larger excursion was above the OPEN - but the opening candle's own range IS
    part of the day's range. A green 30m bar that runs 0.5% has already
    contributed that 0.5% to (high - open). The measure contained its own
    predictor, which is why the numbers rose monotonically with window length:
    5m 67%, 10m 72%, 15m 76%, 30m 82%. **The longer the window, the more of the
    day it physically contains.** The 89% cell was the most contaminated, not
    the best.

    ⚠️ BUT THE OPERATOR IS RIGHT THAT IT IS NOT PURE ARTIFACT. A trend day
    genuinely does begin at the open; the opening candle is the START of the
    move, not a coincidence. Two claims are tangled and only one is tradeable:
        "the opening move is PART of the day's move"  - descriptively true, and
            unactionable: by the time you know the bar was green it is spent.
        "AFTER the opening, price CONTINUES that way" - actionable, and the
            only number a trigger can use.
    Both are reported. **The GAP between them is how much of the day's move
    happens during the opening window** - worth knowing on its own, and if it
    accounts for all of it, the design consequence is that you must be in before
    10:00, which points straight at ORB.
