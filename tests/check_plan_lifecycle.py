tests/check_plan_lifecycle.py  v1.0
v1.0  2026-09-01  r212 (chunk D) — A PLAN CLOSES WHEN ITS TRADE DOES.

🔴 THE DEFECT, MEASURED FROM THE OPERATOR'S OWN PANEL. On 2026-09-01 QQQ showed
SEVEN `RunawayContinuation TRIGGERED @ 708.43` rows, every one flagged `<- LIVE`
— while six of those trades had closed hours earlier. `PlanTick.take()` opens a
`plan_ledger` row on every fire, and `transition()` had exactly TWO callers,
main.py's ORB plan and the condor's `_plan_id`. Nothing closed a row opened
through `Plan._ledger_open`, so `closed_ts` stayed NULL for the session and
`live_plans()` returned every fired plan forever.

🔴 AND r199 MISDIAGNOSED IT AS DUPLICATION. It saw two rows for one strategy at
one trigger, called them duplicates, collapsed them for display and printed the
count so "the duplication stays visible". They were never duplicates — they
were real, distinct plans that had not been closed, and the collapse was
merging trades with different outcomes because the key (strategy, state,
trigger) cannot tell two runaway fires at one boundary apart. RPT.5 recorded
that the WRITE side had never been examined; this is that examination.

⚠️ TWO LEAKS, NOT ONE. A plan that FILLS is closed by its exit. A plan that
FIRES and is then refused — sizing rejection, no priced contract, a failed
order — links no trade at all, so the exit hook can never reach it. Both are
covered, and they are kept DISTINCT: "fired and lost" and "fired and never
filled" are the two populations this ledger exists to separate.

⚠️ EVERY CHECK BELOW EXECUTES. WORKING_AGREEMENT 21 — a test that reads source
proves nothing about runtime, and this whole defect is a call that was never
made.

Born red at 631b0e9 (r211), where L1-L5 all fail.
