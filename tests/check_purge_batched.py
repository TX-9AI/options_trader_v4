# options-trader-v4/tests/check_purge_batched.py — v1.0
# v1.0 (2026-09-22) — r416 / OPS.39. THE PURGE COMMITS AS IT GOES, OR A BOX
#   NEVER CATCHES UP.
#   🔴 THE DEFECT, MEASURED ON TWO LIVE BOXES. Every DELETE ran inside ONE
#   transaction committed after the LAST table. At ~93 seconds per million
#   rows that needed ~28 minutes on PLTR's 18M backlog and ~82 on QQQ's 53M,
#   against the conductor's 900s per-box budget. The run was killed, the whole
#   transaction rolled back — including tables that had finished — and the next
#   night faced MORE rows. PLTR reached 19.8 days against a 3-day policy and
#   97% disk; QQQ reached 19.9 days and 59.5M rows, while the other thirteen
#   boxes sat at 3.8 days and looked fine.
#   🔑 B2 IS THE CHECK THAT MATTERS AND THE ONE THE OLD CODE COULD NOT PASS:
#   **an interrupted run must KEEP what it committed.** That single property
#   converts the ratchet into convergence — a box that cannot drain in one
#   night drains over two instead of resetting to zero forever.
#   ⚠️ B4 EXISTS BECAUSE THE REPORT LIED FOR WEEKS. `removed[table]` was set
#   from the COUNT, never from the commit, so the conductor logged
#   `PLTR: plan_check 478,995` on a night PLTR still held 479,001 of them. A
#   number that reports INTENT as OUTCOME is why nobody saw this.
"""Gate: retention deletes are batched, committed incrementally, and reported
from what committed.

B1   a full run drains the window
B2   an INTERRUPTED run keeps its committed progress (the ratchet fix)
B3   ...and a second run finishes the job
B4   the reported number is what COMMITTED, not what was counted
B5   no COUNT(*) on the apply path (r405's lesson)
