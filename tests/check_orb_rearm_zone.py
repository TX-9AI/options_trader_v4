tests/check_orb_rearm_zone.py  v1.4
v1.4  2026-09-03  r228 — Z1g-Z1j: a 1m CLOSE back INSIDE the range ends the
      thesis. r221 armed UNCONDITIONALLY — it never consulted where price was
      — so a trade resolving after a re-entry would have stayed armed on a
      dead impulsive candle, and would have overwritten a `close_inside`
      invalidation the tick machinery had already applied. Mirrored on both
      sides.
v1.3  2026-09-03  r227 — Z1d/Z1e/Z1f: the per-confirmation latches are cleared
      and the impulsive candle is not. Without the clear, `order_placed`
      survives and orb_strategy refuses every subsequent retest — verified by
      deleting the line and watching Z1d go red.
v1.2  2026-09-03  r226 — 🔴 THIS FILE WAS WALL-CLOCK DEPENDENT AND WOULD HAVE
      GONE RED EVERY AFTERNOON. `notify_position_closed` compares `now_et()`
      against ORB's own entry cutoff and returns EXPIRED past it, so Z1, Z1c
      and Z3c passed before 11:00 ET and failed after — caught at 11:51 on
      the day it was written. A check whose verdict depends on WHEN it runs
      teaches the suite to be ignored in the afternoon. The clock is frozen
      inside orb_engine's own namespace, since that is where `now_et` is
      resolved.
v1.1  2026-09-03  r222 — S1-S5 MIRROR EVERY CHECK ON THE SHORT SIDE. The
      operator's example was a long and so was every original check; the
      engine's geometry is symmetric but r221's `long_side` flag decides the
      DIRECTION of the `beyond` comparison, and a flipped comparison would
      accept a short's 50% the instant price ROSE — handing every short to
      the runaway immediately. S2 is that check.
v1.0  2026-09-03  r221 — THE BAND BETWEEN THE BOUNDARY AND THE 50% HAD NO OWNER.

🔴 `notify_position_closed` ALWAYS CALLED `_rearm()`, WHICH WIPES ORBData. The
impulsive candle went with it and the engine sat in AWAITING_RANGE_REENTRY, so
a second retest of the boundary FROM OUTSIDE could arm nothing. Meanwhile the
runaway will not take the move until a 1m close beyond `target_50pct` HOLDS.
Measured on NVDA, 2026-09-03: broke 227.43, retested, entered, exited in
profit — and 227.43 -> 228.77 was owned by NO strategy.

🔑 A RETEST AND A RE-ENTRY ARE DIFFERENT EVENTS. The operator's correction, and
the distinction the whole change rests on:
  · RETEST   = wick into the range, close back OUTSIDE. A TEST. Fires a trade,
               leaves the impulsive candle intact.
  · RE-ENTRY = a CLOSE back INSIDE the range. ACCEPTANCE. Terminates the
               thesis; a fresh break must set a new impulsive candle.
"Wicks are tests & closes are acceptance."

⚠️ AND THE 50% HANDOFF USES THE RUNAWAY'S OWN TWO-PART TEST. Standing down on a
TOUCH of the 50% would end the ORB thesis while the runaway never armed —
re-opening the same gap one level higher.

Born red at 9b29ec5 (r220), where Z1 and Z4 fail.
