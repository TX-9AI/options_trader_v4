tests/check_orb_restart.py  v1.1
v1.1  2026-08-30  r195 — three cases asserted the literal
      WAITING_FOR_BREAK after a re-arm. r195 splits that into two honest
      states — AWAITING_RANGE_REENTRY when price is outside the range,
      WAITING_FOR_BREAK once a closed bar is back inside — so they now
      assert THE ENGINE RE-ARMED, which is what they were always for.

r95 — A RESTART MUST NOT ERASE THE SESSION, AND MUST NOT BUY A LATE ENTRY.

🔴 THE DEFECT THIS PINS. `_load_range_from_file()` restores the RANGE across a
restart; nothing restored the STATE, so a restarted engine came back to
WAITING_FOR_BREAK with the session's history erased — no break latches, no
attempt count, and no memory of a runaway invalidation.

🔴 THE CASE THAT MATTERS MOST IS C8, AND IT REMOVES A TRADE RATHER THAN ADDING
ONE. After a runaway the engine is deliberately dormant and never re-arms. A
restart forgot that and would arm on a later break the design exists to refuse.

🔴 AND C2b IS THE OPERATOR'S RULING, 2026-08-24: **"DO NOT TAKE A MISSED ENTRY
as permission to enter LATE... jumping in after it has left the station is not
a remedy for missing it."** A reconstructed OPEN_* is recorded and CONSUMED.
There must be no path from the reach-back to a fired entry, and C2b is what
stops a future edit from quietly opening one.

Measured live 2026-08-24: QQQ's ORB plan was recorded CANCELLED /
WIPED_BY_RESTART @ 706.00 at 09:40 by the crash-loop.

⚠️ BORN RED. Against the pre-r95 engine C1/C8 fail. Verified by neutering
`rebuild_from_tape` — see WORKING_AGREEMENT 21 ("the proof a test is real: it
FAILS against the broken version") and 24 (a canary checks BEHAVIOUR, never a
version string).

⚠️ IT CALLS THE ENGINE, IT DOES NOT READ ITS SOURCE. WORKING_AGREEMENT 21: a
test that asserts on source text proves nothing about runtime. Every case below
drives real transitions and asserts on the resulting state.

Plain script with an exit code, deliberately not pytest (WORKING_AGREEMENT 36:
a red that means "this venv has no pytest" teaches an operator to ignore reds).
