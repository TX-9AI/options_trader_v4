tests/scrub_headers.py — v4.0 — 2026-08-19

RESET EVERY PORTED FILE'S HEADER TO 4.0. TOUCH NOTHING ELSE.

    python3 tests/scrub_headers.py --src <otv3> --dst <otv4> --list <manifest>

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
WHAT IT REMOVES AND WHAT IT MUST NOT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
**REMOVES:** the OTV3 CHANGELOG — the stacked `vX.Y  <date>  <TITLE>` blocks at
the top of each file. OTV4 starts at 4.0 with a fresh history.

⚠️ **KEEPS, ABSOLUTELY: EVERY IN-BODY COMMENT.** Lines like *"this crash-looped
NFLX every 15 seconds"*, *"the veto window and the confirmation window were the
same window"*, *"0 is the permissive answer"* are **the reason the code is the
way it is.** They are not history; they are the guardrails. Stripping them would
discard exactly the knowledge OTV4 exists to inherit — and the next engineer
would rediscover each defect the expensive way.

⚠️ **KEEPS the descriptive first line.** `"analysis/liquidity_mapper.py — named
pools, sections, ladder"` says what the module IS. That survives; only the
version history below it is replaced.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
WHY A TOOL AND NOT A `sed`
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Four distinct header shapes exist in OTV3:
  1. `\"\"\"` · `path  vX.Y  date  TITLE` · changelog
  2. `\"\"\"` · `path  addendum vX.Y (see below); original header follows.` · changelog
  3. `\"\"\"` · `path  Description.` · prose · `vX.Y date ...` further down
  4. `#!/bin/bash` · `# ===` · `# path  vX.Y`

A regex that handles three of them silently mangles the fourth. **Every write is
verified: the file must still parse, and the body byte-count must be unchanged.**
