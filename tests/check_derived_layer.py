tests/check_derived_layer.py  v4.0

The derived layer informs and never blocks, absence is never zero, and
the 0DTE term decays.

v4.0  2026-08-22  Built with the manifold. See docs/DERIVED_STORES.md.

TWO PROPERTIES, both operator rulings, both of which this repo has violated
before at real cost:

  1. **DERIVERS ARE CONTRIBUTORS, NEVER GATES.** No write path in the derived
     layer may raise into a caller's decision path. A derived value that
     cannot be produced is simply absent; the engine trades without it. This
     is the rule the regime labels violated — a label nothing computed became
     a veto that stopped a fleet for a whole session.

  2. **ABSENCE IS NULL, NEVER 0.0.** A charm of zero means delta is stable —
     a real and useful reading. A charm that could not be computed is the
     absence of a reading. VW.1 burned five layers on exactly this confusion;
     the gap prior_dir and the sweep score were both silent zeros that read as
     measurements.

⚠️ C2 IS THE ONE THAT MATTERS AND IT IS ADVERSARIAL. It hands the writers a
poisoned connection and asserts they SWALLOW the failure. A checker that only
tests the happy path would pass against a deriver that takes the bot down.

BORN RED: revert `_write`'s try/except and C2 fails; make `vanna` return 0.0 on
a flat IV and C3 fails.

Run:  cd ~/options-trader && python3 tests/check_derived_layer.py
