r95 — A MISSED SETUP IS A HEADSTONE, NOT A LOCK.

🔴 THE OPERATOR'S RULING, 2026-08-24, in two halves that pull against each
other and must BOTH hold:

    "An interrupted firing sequence should never attempt a late entry. Log it
     as missed. But normal entries that weren't filled and weren't interrupted
     should keep trying."

    "The condor is special. Leg 2 is permitted not implied. A miss of one
     firing sequence does not take another valid entry off the table."

The first half is easy to implement and easy to over-implement. The dangerous
failure is the SECOND one: a `MISSED` record that quietly becomes a reason to
refuse the next trade. That would look like caution and read like a bug fix,
and it would cost trades silently — the exact shape of every defect in
`docs/PORT_STATE.md`'s plausible-silence list.

⚠️ SO THE INVARIANT IS: THE PLAN LEDGER IS A RECORD, NOT AN AUTHORITY. Nothing
in the entry path may read it. Today that holds — every gating read is either
process-local (`has_active_plan`) or the trades DB (`_open_credit_sides`,
`_condor_leg_open_without_plan`) — and this file is what stops a later edit
from "improving" that by consulting the ledger.

⚠️ IT CHECKS BEHAVIOUR AND CALL SITES, NEVER SOURCE PROSE (WORKING_AGREEMENT
21/20). M1 drives a real sqlite ledger. M3 parses the import graph for READS,
scoped to the shape of a call, so a changelog line naming the ledger cannot
trip it.

Plain script with an exit code, deliberately not pytest (WORKING_AGREEMENT 36).
