tests/check_status_panel.py  v1.0
v1.0  2026-09-01  r211 (chunk C) — THE MIDDLE OF THE STATUS BOARD.

Operator, 2026-09-01, going through `status.py`: open positions "just list the
number (nothing else)"; the duplicate-plan warning "what do I need this for —
get rid of that"; ORB "on expired, just say that without all the other
qualifiers, it's unimportant, it's just expired"; and "add a line for
Character. I know it's not activated yet, so put 'inactive' until it is."

🔑 THE CHARACTER LINE WAS ALREADY THERE AND HAS NEVER PRINTED. r75 wrote it and
gated it on `current()` returning a character; r85 then set BANDS_SET=False
because the old bands were calibrated against the wrong quantity — a per-bar
volatility RATIO, silent about direction, which scored a trend 1.00 and
ALTERNATING CHOP 1.00 as well. So the engine emits no state and the line has
been invisible on every box since. ABSENT AND INACTIVE ARE DIFFERENT FACTS and
printing nothing said neither.

🔴 AND THE EXPIRED LABEL WAS STALE. It read "past 11:00 ET cutoff"; r193 moved
`ORB_NO_ENTRY_AFTER_ET` to 11:30 on 2026-08-30 and the label kept the old
number. A line nobody reads is a line nobody notices going stale — which is the
argument for deleting it rather than correcting it.

⚠️ C2 IS THE ONE THAT MATTERS MOST. Removing the duplicate-count line does NOT
mean the duplication is gone: r199 printed that count so the ledger defect
stayed visible, and RPT.5 records the WRITE side was never examined. Chunk D
repairs the writer. Until then the collapse must REMAIN, or two identical plans
render as two rows and the panel is wrong in the other direction.

Born red at ff5140b (r210), where C1, C2, C3, C4 and C5 all fail.
