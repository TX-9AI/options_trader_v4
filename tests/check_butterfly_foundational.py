v1.0  2026-09-01  r208 — THE THREE CONDITIONS RELAXED MAY NEVER WAIVE.

Operator, 2026-09-01, after five flies fired on the first tick of the noon
window and three were stopped out inside the same minute: *"there's a couple of
things minimum that need to be met even on relaxed entries. They are: Is price
pinning right now? can the Pin even be reached? Can the floor clear the spread?
If any of those are 'no' then I don't even want a relaxed one taking it."*

🔴 WHAT HAPPENED, MEASURED FROM THE ALERTS RATHER THAN REASONED. Five flies at
12:00:00 ET; META 577.5±2 ×30 at debit 0.17, CRM 260±2 ×25 at 0.21, MU 980±5
×19 at 0.28. `BUTTERFLY_STOP_LOSS_PCT` is 0.25 OF THE DEBIT, so the floors were
4.3c, 5.3c and 7.0c. A fly's value is `lower + upper - 2*center` — a small
difference of three larger numbers — so three legs of quote noise compound into
a figure that is itself 17 cents. All three closed the same minute at -26% to
-35%: stopped out by their own marks, not by price.

⚠️ THE GATE FOR THIS ALREADY EXISTED AND HAD ONE CALLER. r154 built
`criteria.stop_survivable` after CVX entered the same spread seven times in
seven minutes, and scoped it to the sweep. The butterfly was not on that list
because on 2026-08-27 it had never fired. It has had no survivability check for
its entire life.

Born red at f74818b, where F1, F2, F4, F5 and F7 all fail.
