tests/edge_scan.py  v1.1
v1.1  2026-08-23  S3 default source: trades from raw/trades, fire snapshots
and plans from raw/derived_* (s3_push v4.3, latest-per-rid). --db/--derived
remain the explicit local escape hatch. The bar is unchanged and will not be
softened to produce output; NOT YET is the expected answer for weeks.
v1.0  2026-08-23
WHERE THE R MIGHT LIVE — every derived feature at fire time, tested against
dollar outcomes with a PRE-REGISTERED bar; plus the unfired plans, scored.

v1.0  2026-08-23  Built for the R-factor project. This is the "fit our
trades to collected data when a correlation becomes evident" tool — and its
job is mostly to say NOT YET. The bar is registered here, before any data
exists, so nobody (including me) can tune it to produce a pleasing result:

  MEETS THE BAR  (all of): n ≥ 200 rows over ≥ 10 sessions per side ·
                 Mann-Whitney p < 0.05 · |Cliff's delta| ≥ 0.147 ·
                 sign stable across session halves.
  CANDIDATE      (n ≥ 30 per side, |delta| ≥ 0.147): worth watching, moves
                 NOTHING. Thin samples find mechanisms, not conclusions.

Sources joined per trade_id: `fire_snapshot.payload` (the derived vector at
fire — charm, vanna, gex, VRP, expected move, levels, session fraction),
trade columns (adx_at_entry, gap_pct), outcome = pnl_usd. Calls and puts
scanned SEPARATELY (the 34.2% put signature pools away). Relaxed excluded.

UNFIRED PLANS (the free backtests, plan_ledger r69/r70): every EXPIRED /
CANCELLED plan with max/min_price_seen is scored against its own trigger and
strikes — would price have reached the trigger, and where did it go after?
Fired vs unfired outcome distributions measure THE TRIGGER ITSELF.

⚠️ OUTPUT IS LOG-ONLY PROPOSALS. A line that meets the bar prints the exact
number a config change would cite (AUDIT.md §5.1) and stops there. Every
gate ships LOG-ONLY and is judged on outcomes before it may refuse a trade
(VISION.md) — this tool is upstream of even that.
