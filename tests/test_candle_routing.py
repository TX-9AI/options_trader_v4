tests/test_candle_routing.py — one subscription, one route. v1.0
v1.0 — 2026-08-20 — INITIAL (candle_feed v3.16).

THE DEFECT, stated as what happened rather than as a rule: FEED.2 subscribes
the same dx symbol at the same interval TWICE — once RTH-only, once with
extended hours — and both registrations used the key (dx_symbol, interval).
Identical keys, so the second silently overwrote the first, and every 1h
candle was routed to the EXT store symbol. Fleet-wide, plain QQQ and SPX 1h
froze at 2026-08-14 while *_EXT stayed current: six days of stale
higher-timeframe structure feeding the swing book, S/R, the pitchfork and
entry_snapshot. Nothing raised. BARS_STALE warned every five minutes with
`refused=False` and the bots kept trading on 08-14 bars.

Four properties, all asserted as DECISIONS on real function calls:

  A. THE ECHO IS DISTINGUISHABLE. `tho=true` is the only thing separating the
     two streams and `_interval_of` deliberately discards it, so the router
     must read it independently — including DXFeed's canonicalised forms
     (`{=h,tho=true}`), which is the shape that broke the parser in v3.7.
  B. ROUTING IS CORRECT IN BOTH DIRECTIONS. An RTH echo reaches the plain
     symbol and an extended echo reaches *_EXT. Asserting only the EXT side
     would have passed while the bug was live.
  C. THE GUARD REFUSES A COLLISION. Two subscriptions sharing a route key, a
     subscription with no route, and two subscriptions writing one target must
     each stop the feed from starting. The original defect was not a typo —
     it was a route table that could lose an entry silently.
  D. NOTHING ELSE MOVED. 1m/5m/15m/1d and VIX still route exactly as before.

Run:  cd <repo> && python3 tests/test_candle_routing.py
Deliberate-failure proof: OT_ROUTE_SELFTEST=1 reverts the router to the old
two-part key in this test's own copy; case B must go red.
