# options-trader-v4/tests/check_reclaim_paths.py — v1.0
# v1.0 (2026-09-23) — r420 / OPS.43. THE RECLAIM LIST MUST NAME THE FILE THE
#   REST OF THE SYSTEM WRITES TO.
#   🔴 THE DEFECT. `retention_purge` reclaimed `HERE/data/trades.db`. That file
#   exists on every box and holds ZERO TABLES. The fleet's actual trade record
#   is `HERE/trades.db`, one directory up — so the nightly reclaim has never
#   checkpointed or vacuumed the database it names, and the log line
#   `reclaim trades.db  checkpoint ok, wal 0MB -> 0MB` was TRUE OF THE WRONG
#   FILE. A number that is correct about the wrong object is the hardest kind
#   to catch, because nothing about it looks broken.
#   📊 COST TODAY IS NIL AND THE ROW SAYS SO: measured fleet-wide before the
#   fix, the real trades.db is 0.1-0.3MB with a 0MB WAL and 0MB free pages, so
#   there was nothing to reclaim. This is a correctness gate, not a disk one,
#   and it is written that way rather than claiming a saving it cannot show.
#   🔑 P1 AND P4 ARE THE CHECKS THAT MATTER, AND THEY ARE ANTI-DRIFT RATHER
#   THAN ANTI-TYPO. The cause was a THIRD hardcoded literal for a path
#   `config.DB_PATH` and `s3_push.TRADES_DB` already owned. Fixing the literal
#   fixes today; pinning the two owners together is what stops the next one —
#   WA §7, and when there must be two readers, a check that they AGREE.
#   ⚠️ P4 DRIVES THE OVERRIDE because agreeing on the default is the easy half.
#   Two modules can share a default and still diverge the moment an env var is
#   set, and `OT_TRADES_DB` is exactly the knob an operator would reach for.
"""Gate: the reclaim list names the real databases, and cannot drift.

P1  both owners name a trades.db, neither under data/       (shape)
P2  the reclaim list contains it, and NOT the data/ decoy
P3  feed_store / derived_store still resolve under data/     [control]
P4  an OT_TRADES_DB override moves BOTH, not one             (anti-drift)
