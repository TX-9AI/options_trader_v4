"""tests/check_self_close_hold.py — v1.0
A FAILED DRAIN HOLDS THE BOX, WHATEVER ELSE THE VERIFIER PRINTS.

v1.0  2026-09-26 — otv4 r443, MIRRORED VERBATIM from OTV4TEST r147 (babd06a),
      sha256 6e036ffc2f993a00d05159b534d2dfeef63c2ff5142187d47d3175bbbc72dce2.
      `self_close` read `drift = "COUNTER DRIFT" in out` and let it override
      `not ok` whatever `failed=` said. A counter-drift line is printed whenever
      every remaining gap is <= 2, and an S3 delete that EMPTIES a prefix the
      box's counter still claims leaves a PERMANENT gap of 1 (a got=0 prefix
      never heals). Measured 2026-09-26: SOFI carried six such prefixes and
      mainline 31 across 15 boxes, so on those boxes a drain with a failed PUT
      HALTED and ran the purge where it was built to HOLD and page. Shared with
      OTV4TEST under WA §38.2 / §38.11; they authored, otv4 mirrors.

  H1  failed=0, short=0, OK                        -> halts (the normal close)
  H2  failed=0, short>0, COUNTER DRIFT printed     -> halts (r171's ruling, unchanged)
  H3  failed=1, short=0                            -> HELD, alerted, no purge, no shutdown
  H4  failed=1, short>0, COUNTER DRIFT printed     -> HELD (the defect: HEAD halts here)
  H4b as H4, with a stray " failed=0 " elsewhere   -> still HELD
      (failed= is read from the DRAIN line, which owns it; a mutant reading the
      whole output passed H1-H5 and is what this case exists to kill)
  H5  failed=0, short>0, no drift line (gap >= 3)  -> HELD (unchanged)

🔴 NOTHING REAL RUNS. `subprocess.run` is replaced by a recorder, so no
`systemctl`, no verifier and no `shutdown`; `retention_purge.main` is replaced
by a recorder (the real purge opens the live feed store whatever the
environment says); the alert manager is replaced so nothing reaches Telegram.
OT_INSTRUMENT is set so box_instrument() never reads the unit.
