"""tests/check_orb_geometry_size.py  v2.0
ORB sizes on ACTUAL risk, and THE ORDER RECEIVES THAT NUMBER.

v2.0  2026-08-30  r192 — REWRITTEN TO EXECUTE. v1.0 pinned the bug:
      it re-implemented the geometry inside the test and asserted the
      PRESENCE of `signal.contracts = _geo` in main.py source. G5 now
      captures the quantity handed to `_place_single_leg`.

🔴 v1.0 DID NOT MISS r181's DEFECT — IT PINNED IT, AND THAT IS WHY THIS IS A
REWRITE RATHER THAN AN EXTENSION. Its G1-G3 re-implemented the geometry inside
the test (`def geo(w,d): return max(1,int(w//d))...`) and asserted against that
private copy, so they passed whether or not the repo computed anything at all.
Its G5 read main.py as SOURCE TEXT and asserted `"signal.contracts = _geo" in
b` — the presence of the exact assignment that wrote a field the order never
reads. It was green for two days while every ORB trade shipped one lot, and any
correct repair would have turned it red. WORKING_AGREEMENT §21: a test that
reads source and never executes proves nothing, and this one argued for the bug.

🔑 G5 IS THE ONLY CHECK THAT WOULD HAVE CAUGHT r181, and it is the reason this
file exists: it captures the quantity handed to `_place_single_leg` — the
argument that becomes the broker order — and asserts it equals the geometry.
Everything above it is arithmetic; only G5 is the claim.

Born red at r191 (4eaceb9): `size_for` does not exist there, and the ordered
quantity is the budget rule's answer regardless of geometry.
