"""tests/check_disk_watch.py — v1.2
v1.2  2026-09-06 — r287 / DEV.9. D8 pins the SENTINEL DRILL: it fires through
the live path, it is consumed so it cannot loop, and it bypasses the rate limit.

v1.1  2026-09-06 — r286 / DEV.8. D7 pins that a send which RETURNS FALSE is
reported as a failure and RE-ARMS. v1.0 returned True regardless of the result,
so an unconfigured Telegram would have logged a successful alert and paged
nobody — and left `over` set, so every later cycle stayed silent too.

v1.0  2026-09-06 — r285 / DEV.7.

🔴 THIS RUNS INSIDE `candle_feed`'s LOOP, ON FIFTEEN LIVE BOXES. A bug here does
not cost an alert — it costs the TAPE. So D5 asserts the one property that
matters more than any of the others: **`check()` never raises**, whatever the
filesystem or the sender does.

⚠️ AND THE ALERT MUST FIRE ONCE PER EPISODE, NOT ONCE PER CYCLE. A box sitting
at 93% that paged every five minutes would train the operator to skim exactly
the alert that matters (§17) — and an alert that fires once and never re-arms is
the opposite failure, silent on the next crossing. Both directions are pinned.
