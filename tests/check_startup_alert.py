"""tests/check_startup_alert.py — v1.0
v1.0  2026-09-18 — r387. THE BOOT ALERT CARRIES THE BOX'S PUBLIC IP.

🔑 PORTED FROM OTV4TEST r22, WHERE THE OPERATOR BUILT IT — not re-invented here.
The implementation and this harness are his; what otv4 added is the fleet-wide
verification below, because OTV4TEST's own note records checkip as confirmed
against the console for ONE instance (i-0b071815bfb8e2d6a).

📊 VERIFIED ACROSS ALL 15 PRODUCTION BOXES, 2026-09-18 19:04 ET, before this
shipped: each box was asked for BOTH its IMDSv2 `public-ipv4` (authoritative —
what AWS assigned) and `checkip.amazonaws.com` (what the internet sees), and
they MATCHED 15 of 15. No box egresses through a NAT, so checkip is the address
that actually accepts SSH on every one of them. Had any box differed, this
feature would have printed a plausible wrong address — the precise failure the
`ip_address()` parse below exists to prevent, one layer further out.
⚠️ AND ONE NOTE IN OTV4TEST's HEADER IS NARROWER THAN IT READS: it says IMDS
"could not be exercised from this box's assistant session". That is true from
CONTROL; from the boxes themselves IMDSv2 answered all 15 without trouble. The
choice of checkip still stands — it is verified equal and needs no token — but
IMDS is not unavailable, only unavailable from where it was tried.

The operator reaches a misbehaving box by its public IP, which changes on every
stop/start; without it on the alert he is in the AWS console fighting two-factor
at exactly the moment he needs to be on the box. So the IP rides the boot alert.

Drives the REAL `AlertManager.send_startup_alert` and the REAL `public_ip()`
urllib path against a LOCAL HTTP server that plays checkip.amazonaws.com.

  A0  the existing fields survive: mode, instrument, restart type (CONTROL)
  A1  a good reply lands in the alert as `IP <address>`
  A2  a reply that is not an IP (a captive portal page) is REFUSED and NAMED,
      and the alert still sends
  A3  an unreachable endpoint is NAMED, and the alert still sends
  A4  a hung endpoint is abandoned within the bound — it cannot hold the boot
  A5  `public_ip()` never raises, on any of the above

🔴 NOTHING HERE CAN REACH TELEGRAM. The manager is built with `__new__`, so its
constructor — which creates a real TelegramSender — never runs; `_send` is a
capture. A check that pages the operator is a false alarm (WORKING_AGREEMENT §17).
Born red at r21 on A1, A2, A3 and A5; A0 and A4 are controls.
