tests/check_note_label.py  v1.0
v1.0  2026-09-04  r239 — THE NOTE LABEL IS CANONICAL. `_note_evaluation` is the
      only writer of `strategy_note`, and it stamped the raw `_safe_strategy`
      dispatch label while the plan ledger and gate rows use the class name.

🔴 MEASURED, 2026-08-31..09-04: the fit report showed "ORB" with 78 fired and
ZERO declined, and "ORBStrategy" with zero fired and 4,260 declined. One
strategy, two rows, and NEITHER arm could ever be fittable — the report said
NOT READY for both, for opposite reasons.

⚠️ `DISPATCH_ALIAS` HAS EXISTED SINCE r147 and was already applied by the plan
board (`plan.py:791`, `:833`) and by `gate_report` (`:118`). This was the one
writer that did not consult it. The fix is a lookup, not a rename — history is
full of rows under the old label and a rename would only fix tomorrow.
