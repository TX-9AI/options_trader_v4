tests/exit_record.py  v4.0
Which exit had the better record in v3? Per exit reason, per strategy.

v4.0  2026-08-19  Built at the OTV4 split. ROADMAP Phase 1.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires this block be read before the file is edited.

THE QUESTION.
The runaway-ORB rule specifies "BOS exit or trailing stop - whichever has a
better record under v3." That is answerable rather than arguable, and this
answers it.

⚠️ WHY THE EXITS ARE THE ONE THING NOT UNDER SUSPICION. Every entry-side
measurement this week came back null - direction accuracy 44.9% (95% CI
[41.3%, 48.6%], worse than a coin), entry conditions ambient, opening bias a
coin forward, four independent searches for direction all empty. **The exits
are the opposite**: orb_trail_stop 95% win / 107 trades / +$37,848, theta_bleed
100% / 107, continuation_trail 85% / 149. Operator, 2026-08-19: *"every day
where P&L was green or very green is nearly entirely based on the ORB trade and
the quality of our stops."*

⚠️ AND A WIN RATE IS NOT A RECORD. An exit that fires on 95% winners may simply
be the exit that fires when a trade is already winning - selection, not skill.
Net dollars, median P&L and the LOSS TAIL are reported beside it, because an
exit taking many small wins and a few catastrophic losses shows 90%+ and loses
money. That asymmetry is exactly what a stop is supposed to prevent, so it is
the number that decides.

⚠️ EXITS ARE NOT INDEPENDENT OF EACH OTHER. Each trade takes exactly one, so a
trailing stop only sees trades a structure stop did not take first. Comparing
them head-to-head compares POPULATIONS as much as MECHANISMS - which is why the
per-strategy split matters and why the honest output is a table, not a winner.
