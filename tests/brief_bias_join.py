tests/brief_bias_join.py  v1.3
v1.3  2026-09-10  r336 - TABLE D (conviction) and TABLE E (per symbol). Operator:
*"I also want to know if per symbol conviction correlates."* D buckets each
call by conviction QUARTILE OF THE DATA rather than an assumed 0..1 scale -
the range is documented nowhere this repo owns, and hardcoded cut points are
how `selector` silently broke when the brief's `scores` payload changed scale.
Cut points are printed. BOTH tables are PER DIRECTION: the LONG calls carry
~0 edge and the SHORT calls may carry some, so pooling would let three times
as many uninformative LONG calls dilute the SHORT signal, or let the LONG base
rate masquerade as conviction working. A conviction of NULL is EXCLUDED and
counted, never bucketed as zero.
v1.2  2026-09-10  r335 - `--rows`: ONE LINE PER SYMBOL-DAY. Operator, on reading
v1.1's output: *"It's not by sym by day like I asked for."* The JOIN was always
per symbol-day; the OUTPUT collapsed straight to five bucket totals, so a single
busy name - META traded 28 times in one session - can carry a bucket with nobody
able to see it happen. Table C prints what the brief said, what the tape did,
what we did and what it made, per symbol per day, off the SAME join, so the two
views cannot disagree. `ours` reads MIXED when a symbol-day holds trades both
ways, because averaging those would invent a position nobody took.
v1.1  2026-09-10  r334 - REFUSES WHEN EVERY TRADE READ FAILED. v1.0 printed
"no closed trades in the window" while all 10,741 objects had been denied by
IAM - an absence the tool manufactured, rendered in the same font as a real
one. That is the shape this whole session has been finding, and it reached
production inside the tool built to avoid it.
v1.0  2026-09-10  r333 / BRF.1 step 2 — DOES THE MORNING BRIEF PREDICT THE
      TAPE, AND DOES TRADING AGAINST IT COST MONEY? Operator's experiment.

🔑 TWO QUESTIONS, DELIBERATELY NOT COLLAPSED — different samples, different
failure modes, and only one of them is about our P&L:

  A. BRIEF vs TAPE — did `composites.direction` match the realized
     close-to-close move? NO TRADES INVOLVED, so it holds on every symbol-day
     the brief scored including days we never traded the name. It is the
     larger sample and the one that decides whether a gate is worth building.
  B. TRADES vs BRIEF — closed trades split AGREE / DISAGREE / NEUTRAL against
     the brief's call for that symbol-day, compared on EXPECTANCY.

A brief that predicts nothing cannot be worth trading with; a brief that
predicts well may still cost nothing to trade against if we rarely do it.
One table cannot answer both, so two are printed and neither is summed.

🔴 CLOSE-TO-CLOSE, GAP INCLUDED — OPERATOR'S RULING, 2026-09-10: *"The gap
should be included because the report is cut before the open."* The brief
publishes ~09:00 ET, so the move it calls begins at the PRIOR SESSION'S close.
Open-to-close would credit it for a call the gap had already resolved.

🔴 THE BASE RATE IS THE TRAP, AND IT IS ALREADY VISIBLE. BULLISH 703 ·
BEARISH 344 · NEUTRAL 156 across 50 sessions — roughly 2:1. If the tape rose
on most days, a blended hit rate reads as skill on the skew alone. **Skill is
reported PER DIRECTION against the tape's own base rate in the same window,
and a blended number is never printed.**

🔑 TWO IMPORTS, NO FALLBACKS, BY DESIGN:
  · `price_bias` from day_trader_pro/standings.py — the ONLY definition of
    which way a position leans (call-ness XOR credit-ness, because a call
    credit spread is bearish). A local copy would drift from the report the
    operator reads.
  · `load_trades_versioned` from warehouse_source (r332) — reads the
    pre-epoch trades r314 soft-deleted, so the study gets all 50 sessions.
If either is missing this tool REFUSES. A fallback would silently answer a
smaller question and print it in the same font as the real one.

⚠️ PRIOR SESSION IS PER SYMBOL, FROM THE TAPE. Not "the calendar day before"
and not "the previous row in the composites table": a holiday, a weekend, or
a box that sat out would otherwise drop the session — and Monday, the highest
gap of the week, is exactly the one you cannot afford to lose.

⚠️ DESCRIPTIVE. Nothing here sizes or gates anything. A counter-bias veto
changes WHAT GETS TRADED and is the operator's call on evidence, not this
tool's (WA §31, §5).
