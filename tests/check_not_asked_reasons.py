tests/check_not_asked_reasons.py  v1.0
v1.0  2026-09-01  r213 (chunk E) — EVERY SKIP NAMES ITSELF.

Operator, 2026-09-01, reading the DECISIONS panel: *"I don't like 'NOT ASKED'
as a reason. It makes no sense. Not asked? why or Why not?"*

He was reading rows like `CondorManagement  NOT ASKED  /  not asked this tick —
dispatch gave no reason`, where the reason restated the verdict and told him
nothing.

🔴 THE CAUSE IS NOT THE WORDING, IT IS A GAP. `CondorManagement`, `CreditRoll`
and every `<Strategy>/manage` row are driven ONLY from main.py's
`has_open_position()` branch. On a flat box they are never called, and no skip
site named them, so they fell to the default on every tick of every flat
session. The other half of that same branch already said the reverse out loud —
"position open — managing; only the second-leg window asks the credit
strategies" — so one direction had a sentence and the other did not.

⚠️ AND A `/manage` ENTRY OUTLIVES ITS POSITION. `REGISTRY` persists for the life
of the process, so once a strategy has managed anything its row keeps reporting
for the rest of the day, long after the trade closed.

🔑 THE DEFAULT NOW ADMITS WHAT IT IS. Every skip main.py can name IS named; the
fallback fires only where none is, so it reads as a dispatch gap rather than a
market condition. r73's rule one level up: a refusal that cannot say which rung
refused it is worse than no refusal, because it gets trusted anyway.

⚠️ THE MEMBERSHIP LIST LIVES IN plan.py, NOT main.py. A new management plan is
covered by REGISTERING, not by someone remembering to add it to a list in
another file — r35's allow-list rot, where a name list held three entries, two
of which had been deleted, while the live strategy was silently exempt.

Born red at 540a807 (r212), where N1, N2 and N4 fail.
