r95 — THE BOARD MUST BE ABLE TO REACH ITS OWN GOOD STATE.

🔴 WHY. Operator, 2026-08-24: "those sections will never be green during RTH &
if used in the dashboard, it would never show green."

`<SYM>_EXT` is the NON-RTH route — candle_feed segregates every out-of-session
bar to it. During RTH it therefore receives nothing and ages, exactly as
designed. Judged against an RTH freshness budget it painted AMBER on every box,
every session, forever, and dragged the rollup to DEGRADED with it. **A rollup
that cannot reach GREEN is not a rollup**, and a permanently-amber row is how a
reader is trained to stop looking (WORKING_AGREEMENT 17 / the CV.1 failure).

The fixture below is built from the SPX board the operator screenshotted at
10:36 ET on 2026-08-24: SPX_EXT fresh (a real extended subscription), VIX_EXT
aged 4868-9308s (pre-market bars, segregated), session_summary aged 3003s, and
prints/underlying/theo at zero rows.

⚠️ IT DRIVES REAL SQLITE AND THE REAL collect()/rollup(). No source reading
(WORKING_AGREEMENT 21).
