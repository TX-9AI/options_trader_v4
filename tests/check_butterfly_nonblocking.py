"""tests/check_butterfly_nonblocking.py  v1.0
A BUTTERFLY BLOCKS NOTHING. AN ORB OR RUNAWAY DEBIT STILL BLOCKS CREDIT.

v1.0  2026-08-31  r197 — born red at r196 (`has_blocking_position` does not
      exist there, and an open butterfly makes the box refuse every entry).

🔴 THIS IS THE RECIPROCAL HALF OF r161, WHICH WAS ONLY EVER BUILT ONE WAY.
r161 exempted the butterfly from the single-position rule ON ENTRY — operator,
2026-08-27: *"I want it to be able to fire regardless if any other open trades
are found"*, TRADES.md §3: *"no position slot, no capital, no competition."*
But `has_open_position()` still counted it, so the butterfly took no slot going
IN and occupied one once it was THERE.

⚠️ MEASURED, 2026-08-31, the first live-fleet session: MU, NFLX and TSLA each
held a 09:45 butterfly and each sat in the second-leg-only branch when the
credit windows opened at 11:30 — `CondorManagement=HOLD(no credit verticals
open)` on all three, so nothing credit-side justified it. One rare
opportunistic trade removed three boxes from the credit side for the day.

🔑 B3 IS THE ONE THAT KEEPS THE FIX HONEST. Operator, correcting me: *"Credit
trades are blocked while a directional debit trade is open (butterfly exempt).
No credit trades while the orb or runaway debit are still open."* So this is
NOT "one open position no longer blocks" — it is "a butterfly, specifically,
does not count." A test that only proved the butterfly case would pass just as
happily against a version that had unblocked everything.

⚠️ B4 GUARDS THE COLLISION THE FIX MAKES REACHABLE. `set_open_position`
REPLACES `_open_records`. Before r197 an entry could never land on a box that
already held a butterfly, so the wipe was unreachable; now it is, and dropping
a butterfly from management leaves it with no trail and no stop.
