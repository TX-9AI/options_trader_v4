RULE 4: which trigger opened leg 1 constrains what may complete it.

🔴 OPERATOR'S RULING, 2026-08-25:
    TREND CS first  → ONLY a sweep, and only on a REJECTION.
    SWEEP first     → a fork tine, geometrically placed on the right side.
    FORK TINE first → another (opposite) fork tine, or a sweep.
    TREND CS may NEVER be leg 2 — *"that move invalidates the whole premise of
    a 'trend' credit spread."*

⚠️ REJECTION IS A SWEEP-CLASS REQUIREMENT, NOT A FORK ONE. Operator: *"a
qualifying PDH/PDL or other named level, but as a SWEEP — fork does not need a
rejection, it is assumed to be stable if it's present."*
