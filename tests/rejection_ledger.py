v4.1  2026-08-25  r65 EXORCISM: every mention of the retired classification
      system removed - identifiers, comments, docstrings, schema. The word
      does not appear in this tree. Full accounting: REMOVAL_LOG (delivery).

What a gate REFUSED — the other half of every measurement.

v4.0  2026-08-19  Ported from options_trader_v3 at the OTV4 split.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
Dated release framing and trivia are stripped; what remains is the
reasoning behind the thresholds, the design guarantees, and the
defects that recur when forgotten. WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires
this block be read before the file is edited.

#!/usr/bin/env python3
analysis/rejection_ledger.py — 
L3.2a — WHAT GOT BLOCKED, BY WHICH GATE, AND WHAT THE TAPE DID AFTERWARD.
Every measurement this desk has built so far looks only at trades that FIRED —
never-favourable, the floor sweep, trigger drift, the excursion report. All of
them are blind to the decisions the system DECLINED. That is half the selection
question missing, and it is the half that tells you what a gate COSTS. Tightening
a gate without it is guessing with extra steps.
THE LABEL THIS PRODUCES, and it is the whole point:
    DODGED   — blocked, and the tape then went AGAINST the intended direction
    MISSED   — blocked, and the tape went the intended way
A gate whose blocks are mostly MISSED is too tight and is costing money
invisibly. A gate whose blocks are mostly DODGED is earning its keep. Neither is
knowable from trades that fired.
FOUR SOURCES, ONE SCHEMA (they do not currently talk to each other):
  `scored`        every scored signal INCLUDING rejects — grade + total + bars
  `disposition`   outcome != "fired": invalid_signal, sizing_rejected, and
                  N.2's `gate_block:<gate>` (vwap, rrr, ...)
  `retest_check`  ORB near-misses, carrying `retest_depth_px` vs `orb_width`
⚠️ LEAK-FREEDOM IS THE ONE THING THAT MUST BE RIGHT. Outcomes are computed
STRICTLY from bars AFTER the decision bar. A join that leaks makes every blocked
trade look prescient — and it would look entirely reasonable doing it. `--verify`
implements the item's own test: shift every decision timestamp forward one bar
and confirm the outcomes CHANGE. If they do not, the join is reading the decision
bar itself and every number below is worthless.
⚠️ THE VERSION HASH CANNOT BE FULLY SATISFIED RETROSPECTIVELY, and pretending
otherwise would be worse than saying so. The item asks every row to carry the
ruleset that produced it. **The journal does not stamp one** — the same gap noted
on 2026-07-29 about engine identity. So rows carry `analysis_hash` (the HEAD this
ledger ran under) and NOT a decision hash, and any row older than the last
behaviour change is pooling decisions from different rulesets. 2026-08-07 alone
two floors. **The fix is upstream: stamp the ruleset onto the journal event.**
Until then, read cross-date pooling with that caveat.
Read-only, stdlib only, always exits 0.
