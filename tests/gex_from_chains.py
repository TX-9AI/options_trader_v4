tests/gex_from_chains.py  v3.0
v3.0  2026-09-20  r395 / GEX.2 — IT STOPS COMPUTING GEX. IT WAS A SECOND
      DEFINITION OF A PRODUCTION QUANTITY AND I GATED IT ONE REVISION AGO
      WITHOUT NOTICING.
      🔴 `data/gex_data.py` is production and has always been authoritative:
        gex_data.py       gamma x oi_proxy x 100 x spot
        this file (v2.0)  gamma x oi       x 100 x spot x spot x 0.01
      The scalar differs by spot/100 (~5.45x on AMD) so SIGN and FLIP LOCATION
      survived, but NET MAGNITUDE was never comparable to production's — and
      the OI differed IN KIND, because production substitutes a SYNTHETIC
      `oi_proxy = max(1, 1000*gamma/mark)` wherever open_interest is 0.
      So a null measured with this file was a claim about MY surface, not
      about the instrument the bot actually trades on. That is the §7 / C.23
      drift this repo keeps finding, in a file whose own v2.0 header said
      "no stub, no proxy".
      🔑 THE FIX IS A DELETION, NOT A REWRITE. `chain_from_snapshot` rebuilds
      an OptionsChain from the warehouse record and hands it to production's
      OWN `compute_gex`. One definition. Verified lossless: `compute_gex`
      reads only gamma, mark, open_interest and strike from a contract, and
      the warehouse carries all four.
      ⚠️ AND THE REPLAY IS EXACT, NOT APPROXIMATE. main.py:4885-4925 feeds the
      SAME `_gex_chain` object to `compute_gex` AND to the snapshot archiver —
      its own comment reads "NO SECOND FETCH ... Same object, one fetch". So
      the warehouse snapshot IS the chain production computed GEX from, and
      feeding it back reproduces production's computation rather than
      resembling it.
      ⚠️ `--proxy-exposure` EXISTS BECAUSE THE PROXY IS A SHAPE CHANGE, NOT A
      CALIBRATION ONE. Where OI is real, GEX is LINEAR in gamma; where it is
      absent, `100000 x gamma^2 x spot / mark` is QUADRATIC. Gamma peaks at
      the money, so the quadratic branch disproportionately amplifies exactly
      the strikes that decide `pin_strike` and `pin_concentration` — and the
      two forms are mixed WITHIN one snapshot, per strike. A single averaged
      disagreement number would bury that as noise, so the exposure is
      reported STRATIFIED BY MONEYNESS. (OTV4TEST's analysis, QQQ-26.)
v2.0  2026-09-19
v2.0  2026-09-19  r391 / GEX.1 — 🔴 IT READ A DIRECTORY FROM ANOTHER MACHINE,
      FOUND NOTHING, AND CALLED THE NOTHING A RESULT.
      `ROOT` defaulted to `/home/claude/cc`, which does not exist on control.
      So `snapshots()` globbed an absent tree, returned `[]` in silence, and
      the report printed — verbatim —
        "NO GAMMA FLIP FOUND IN ANY SNAPSHOT — there is no pin on this tape by
         this definition. ... and that is a REAL ANSWER, NOT A MISSING ONE."
      on ZERO loaded snapshots, exit code 0.
      🔑 THAT SENTENCE IS r39 EXACTLY INVERTED. The tool asserted its own
      absence was the tape's answer, which is the one thing r39 forbids, and
      it is the identical failure `exit_replay` carried for its whole life
      (RPL.1: "quote_series needs its first live sessions" printed while the
      quotes sat in the bucket). MEASURED 2026-09-19: `snapshots()` -> 0,
      rc=0, and a confident five-line conclusion underneath it.
      ⚠️ AND IT WAS ABOUT TO BE LOAD-BEARING. The operator's standing prior is
      that gamma or a derivative does the heavy lifting on ORB, so this was
      the instrument his next hypothesis would have leaned on — the third
      ungated analysis tool in one day found returning confident nothing,
      which is [[CHK.8]] measured rather than argued.
      FIX: input comes from the WAREHOUSE through `warehouse_source`, the same
      lineage every other reader uses; an empty load REFUSES BY NAME and exits
      non-zero; and the conclusion block cannot be reached on an empty set.

REAL GEX FROM THE WAREHOUSE CHAINS — no stub, no proxy.

Input: raw/chain_snapshots/dt=<date>/sym=<symbol>/ via warehouse_source.

⚠️ WHAT IS AND IS NOT REAL HERE
  · `gamma` and `oi` ARE POPULATED — verified: 123/222 contracts carry
    non-zero gamma, 159/222 carry non-zero OI (max 7,326). So dealer gamma
    is computable from this data rather than assumed.
  · ⚠️ `vol` IS ZERO ON ALL 222 CONTRACTS. Anything keyed on contract volume
    is DEAD on this payload and must not be silently substituted.
  · ⚠️ THE DEALER SIGN CONVENTION IS AN ASSUMPTION, NOT A MEASUREMENT.
    Standard practice is dealers long calls / short puts, so
    GEX = gamma*OI*(+1 for calls, -1 for puts). That convention is NOT
    verified against this fleet's own definition and the pin location
    depends on it. Marked ⟨ASSUMPTION⟩ everywhere it matters.

GEX per strike = gamma × OI × 100 × spot² × 0.01, signed by the convention
above. The PIN is the strike where cumulative signed gamma flips — the level
dealer hedging pushes price toward.
