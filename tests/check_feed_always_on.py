tests/check_feed_always_on.py  v4.0

The feed subscribes whenever the box is up, and the RTH series stays pure.

v4.0  2026-08-20  Written with candle_feed v4.3 (the RTH gate removal).

WHY THIS EXISTS. Removing the clock gate makes every box stream 24 hours a day
for the first time in this project's life. Exactly one thing stands between that
and a corrupted tape: the v4.2 write guard, which must route a non-RTH bar to
<SYM>_EXT for EVERY interval — not just the 1h that has an extended
subscription. If that guard were 1h-only, overnight 1m and 5m bars would land in
the plain series and the tape would CHANGE CHARACTER MID-STREAM, which v4.2's
own header calls worse than the gap it replaced.

⚠️ IT EXECUTES THE ROUTER. `_on_candle` is driven with real timestamps at real
ET hours and the resulting store key is read back from the buffer. A source-text
check would pass against a guard that never runs.

⚠️ AND IT PINS THE ONE THING THAT MUST NOT HAVE BEEN REMOVED. MAINTENANCE is a
purpose, not a time; C3 asserts it still stands the feed down, and that it does
so UNCONDITIONALLY — the old block slept only until the next open, and
seconds_until_rth_open() returns 0 during RTH, so maintenance declared inside
the session used to fall through and connect.

BORN RED, verified 2026-08-20 against pristine HEAD c1531a6:
  C1 -> "feed still stands down outside RTH - the gate was not removed"
