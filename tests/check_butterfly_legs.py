tests/check_butterfly_legs.py  v2.2  (2026-09-01, r208)
v2.2  r208: THE BUTTERFLY PINS ARE RE-DERIVED, NOT PATCHED. B1-B3 encoded a
      world that no longer exists — a wing COMPUTED from WING_EM_FRAC and
      snapped to a grid, with R checked afterwards. The wing is now SEARCHED
      over listed strikes and bracketed by R_FLOOR (wide side) and
      stop survivability (narrow side).
      🔴 THE OLD B1 FIXTURE IS THE 2026-09-01 TRADE. A 1-wide ladder on 4c
      legs prices a 0.18 debit at R 4.56, and the old code TOOK it: that is
      META/CRM/MU, three flies stopped out inside the minute they opened on
      floors of 4.3c to 7.0c. It is kept, inverted, as the refusal case —
      r155's rule that a fixture encoding the replaced rule is re-derived
      rather than deleted.
      B2's premise is gone outright: there is no computed wing to floor at one
      increment. What survives is the CAP (the near wing may not cross spot)
      and the new invariant that candidates come from listed strikes only.
v2.1  r170: clock pinned at 12:30 and atm_iv 0.43 (see check_plan_prepares
      v1.6) — the B pins were time-of-day dependent.
v2.0  (2026-08-27, r160)
v2.0  r160: RENAMED from check_leg2_levels.py. The L1-L13 leg-two pins are
      gone with the code they pinned — the condor no longer selects a level;
      tests/check_plan_prepares.py holds the leg-two hypotheticals now. Only
      the butterfly pins (B1-B4, r147) remain.

THE BUTTERFLY HAS LEGS.

  L1-L4  level_state: UNTESTED / BREACHED / REJECTED / ACCEPTED on a 1m tape,
         using the sweep detector's acceptance count.
  L5     leg two arms on the NEAREST valid level of the COMPLEMENTARY role.
  L6     BREACHED -> HOLD, no signal ("never sell on a level being breached").
  L7     REJECTED -> a VALID credit vertical beyond the level, R recorded.
  L8     STRICT vetoes a sub-1:1 leg two; RELAXED takes and records r_muted.
  L9     ACCEPTED -> the level is finished and the plan moves to the NEXT one.
  L10    a finished level survives a restart (reloaded from plan_ledger).
  L11    no candidate -> HOLD row saying leg two is off the table.
  L12    the pairing table filters level CLASS (trend-first -> named pools only).
  B1     the 2026-09-01 fly (1-wide ladder, 4c legs, R 4.56) is REFUSED, and
         the row names WHICH bound refused it.
  B2     a qualifying ladder fires the NARROWEST wing that clears both bounds.
  B3     no wing clears R 1.00 -> refused, best-available R stated.
  B4     no exact strike at the pin -> refused, never a nearest substitute.
