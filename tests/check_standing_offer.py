"""tests/check_standing_offer.py  v1.1
THE ORB STANDING OFFER: one order, supervised from both branches, and the
BROKER declares the position.

v1.1  2026-09-01  r207 — S3 IS RE-DERIVED AND THE FIXTURE STOPS ROTTING.
      S3 asserted that a paper offer at a price "not back to the level" was
      LEFT STANDING. That premise is retired by operator ruling — "in paper
      mode, they ALL fill" — and the arithmetic behind it was wrong anyway:
      it compared the UNDERLYING price to the OPTION STRIKE. Re-derived rather
      than deleted, per r155: a fixture whose numbers encode the rule being
      replaced is the trap, not the test.
      ⚠️ AND `SNAP["expiry"]` WAS HARDCODED "2026-08-31". `get_open_trades_live()`
      drops rows whose expiry has passed, so S5/S5b went red on 2026-09-01 and
      would have stayed red forever — verified by running this file unmodified
      at f74818b. Now relative to today. r170's lesson: a hypothetical pinned
      to a wall-clock value is a check that eventually fails for a reason that
      has nothing to do with the code.
      ⚠️ THIS FILE STILL DOES NOT DRIVE `_place_single_leg`, which is the gap
      that let r195 go green over a path that never executed in paper. That
      coverage lives in tests/check_orb_sequence.py S9.
v1.0  2026-08-30  r195 — backlog ORB.2. Born red at r194 (0b0d15a):
      `execution/resting_orders.py` does not exist there, ORB walks the ladder,
      and nothing supervises an unfilled order.

🔑 S5 AND S6 ARE THE TWO THAT MATTER, and neither is about a flag.
  S5 — adoption is IDEMPOTENT. The supervisor calls adopt on every fill DELTA,
       so a 4-then-10 partial calls it twice. Booking two positions for one
       contract the broker holds once is worse than booking none.
  S6 — the order saying "filled" is NOT permission to book. Operator's ruling
       is that broker POSITIONS declare the position; if the order reports fills
       and the book does not list the contract, we page and book nothing.

⚠️ S1 IS A SOURCE CHECK AND IT IS THE ONLY ONE HERE, DELIBERATELY. Whether ORB
alone bypasses the ladder is a fact about a predicate, not about a run — there
is no execution that proves a NEGATIVE for every other strategy. Everything
else in this file EXECUTES.
