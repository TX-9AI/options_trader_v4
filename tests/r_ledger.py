tests/r_ledger.py  v1.7
v1.7  2026-09-10  r344 - `is_credit()`: the flag first, `credit_received > 0`
as the fallback. `is_short_position` had NO WRITER anywhere until r343, so
every row already in the book carries the schema default 0 and every credit
trade's MFE and MAE were exchanged - in EXCURSIONS, in capture and giveback,
in the never-favourable split and in stop_sweep. The credit value is the row's
own evidence and has been written at every credit entry site all along, so the
history is recovered WITHOUT REWRITING A SINGLE ROW. Debits are untouched.
v1.6  2026-09-07  r301 - the --all-history help no longer HARDCODES the epoch
date. A second copy of a constant in a help string is a copy that goes stale
silently, which is exactly what the epoch move exposed.
v1.5  2026-09-07  r299 - RELAXED ROWS ARE NO LONGER EXCLUDED, and the header
that documented the opposite is corrected rather than left to rot. Operator's
ruling; the `--include-relaxed` flag is DELETED rather than left as a no-op,
because a flag that advertises a behaviour the code no longer has is worse
than no flag. Also corrects the stale THIN sentence r296 orphaned.
v1.4  2026-09-07  r297 — ENTER MEANS THE WHOLE RECORD, AND A BAD DATE IS
REFUSED. Operator: *"The report doesn't follow the same start date, end date
format as the other reports. And I want it to default to ENTER=all time."*
  🔴 THE FORMAT MISMATCH HID A LIE. The menu asked for `A..B` while report 46
  asks START then END, so a space-separated pair went into `--date` and was
  returned VERBATIM — `dates_of` never parsed that path. The prefix could not
  exist, and the SOURCE banner then printed *"0 object(s) listed (a real,
  empty result — not a missing path)"*. It could not know that. `_valid()`
  now raises and names the string.
  ⚠️ DEFAULT IS DAY ONE ONWARD, NOT LITERALLY ALL TIME, matching report 41.
  The bucket reaches back to 2026-07-06 and r187 exists because pooling the v3
  engines already produced one wrong conclusion quoted as evidence.
  `--all-history` is the explicit override.
v1.3  2026-09-07  r296 — IT FITS ON ONE LINE, AND `THIN` IS GONE. Operator, on
a one-day run: *"Part of it bleeds over to multi-line. I want it to fit on one
line & get rid of the THIN here, once more. No shit it's thin — it's one
day."* The BOOK line ran ~93 chars and the strategy rows 90 (96 with THIN)
against this file's own 78-char rule, so both wrapped and the tail of each
landed under the next label.
  ⚠️ THE MARKER GOES, THE THRESHOLD STAYS. `MIN_N` still suppresses R on a
  thin bucket, which is a REFUSAL TO COMPUTE rather than a label — an R of
  1.57 off two trades is worse than no R at all — and the `n` column already
  carries what the word said.
  ⚠️ NO FEES HERE, BY RULING. The fee columns landed in reports 43 and 46;
  the operator ruled this report keeps its shape.
v1.2  2026-08-29  r189 — THE TWO-POPULATION SPLIT MOVES HERE, AND THE
EXCURSION REPORT IS RETIRED. Operator, 2026-08-29, on whether the v3 reports
are relevant to v4: *"keep the one best suited for otv4 ... preserving the
intent behind the report"*, not the code.
  🔴 WHY THIS TOOL AND NOT THAT ONE. `day_trader_pro/excursion_report.py` is
  49 KB of v3 accumulation: five of its nine trail flavours no longer exist
  anywhere in otv4, `max_loss_floor` — half its floor taxonomy — is gone,
  and six reasons v4 actually emits are in neither list, so its leash and
  floor verdicts scored v4 trades against v3 categories. Everything
  DESCRIPTIVE it computed, this file already had: capture and giveback per
  strategy, per side, per exit reason. Only ONE measurement was unique to it,
  and it is the one below.
  🔑 WHAT THE SPLIT IS FOR, AND IT IS THE WHOLE REASON IT SURVIVED: a losing
  book has two completely different diseases and one number hides both. A
  trade that NEVER went favourable is a SELECTION failure — we should not
  have been in it, and no exit rule can save it. A trade that went favourable
  and gave it back is an EXTENSION failure — the entry was right and the
  management was not. **They have opposite fixes**, and `capture` alone
  cannot separate them, because a never-favourable trade has no MFE to have
  captured any of.
  ⚠️ AND THE THIRD BUCKET IS NOT OPTIONAL. A row with no excursion telemetry
  is NOT a never-favourable trade; it is an UNMEASURED one. Folding the two
  together would turn missing instrumentation into a selection finding — the
  plausible-silence class this project is named after. NO TELEMETRY is
  counted and printed on its own line, always.
v1.1  2026-08-23  S3 IS THE DEFAULT SOURCE. Operator's baseline requirement:
reports run on control against the bucket; nothing runs on a trading box and
nothing is pulled to control. --db survives as a local-debug escape hatch
ONLY when passed explicitly. The SOURCE line prints on every run so an empty
day and an unreachable warehouse can never look alike.
v1.0  2026-08-23
THE R BASELINE. avg win / avg loss, expectancy, capture and giveback —
per strategy, per option side, per exit reason. Dollars (WA §31).

v1.0  2026-08-23  Built for the R-factor project. The operator's frame:
*"by controlling risk it is not essential to have a high win rate if the
R-value is sufficient across all trades taken."* Nothing in the repo printed
R, so the project starts by building the instrument (a number that has never
been measured cannot be boosted; it can only be talked about).

DEFINITIONS — one place, so every later tool agrees:
  R              = avg(win $) / |avg(loss $)|      (breakeven win-rate = 1/(1+R))
  expectancy     = mean(pnl_usd)                   per trade, in dollars
  MFE$ / MAE$    = the excursion columns converted to position dollars,
                   sign-aware: for a SHORT (credit) position a FALLING premium
                   is favourable, so mfe/mae premium map inversely.
  capture        = pnl / MFE$ on trades whose MFE$ > 0 — how much of what the
                   tape offered the exit kept. THE GIVEBACK POPULATION LIVES
                   HERE and it is the R lever the v3 book proved (trails
                   +$62k vs floors/BOS −$44k).
  giveback       = MFE$ − pnl on winners.
  fav_frac       = MFE$ / (entry_premium x 100 x contracts) — how far the
                   trade went in our favour, as a fraction of what was put up
                   (debit) or received (credit). Sign-aware through the same
                   helper, so shorts and longs sit on one scale.
  never favourable = fav_frac <= cut. At cut 0.00 the trade never once
                   traded better than entry.

🔴 RELAXED ROWS ARE INCLUDED (r299). Operator, 2026-09-07: *"I don't want
relaxed entry trades treated any differently from strict. It's all paper.
Leaving it would add a 3rd category that convolutes the totals. I would have
paper, live and relaxed."* The split that matters is PAPER vs LIVE;
`relaxed_entry` is an entry-criteria tag inside paper, not a third book.
⚠️ THIS REVERSES THE LINE THAT STOOD HERE, and the old reasoning is kept
rather than deleted because it is still true of the thing it was about:
*"fitting anything to junk traffic is the exact failure §1.1 predicted."*
That is an argument about FITTING, and this tool fits nothing — it describes.
Applying the tag as a silent filter made report 50 disagree with report 43 by
213 trades and $15,793 on the same window, 70% of the book, with nothing on
the page saying so. The `relaxed_entry` COLUMN is untouched: separable is not
the same as excluded, so the split can be re-made the day a threshold is
actually fitted. RPT.19 carries that.
⚠️ CALLS AND PUTS SEPARATE — 34.2% put accuracy is the sharpest signature in
the inherited data and pooling blunts it.
⚠️ n < MIN_N rows print no R claim (the TAG itself went at r296; the `n`
column says the same thing). Thin samples find
mechanisms, not conclusions (WA §12).
