tests/check_orb_sequence.py  v1.1
v1.1  2026-09-04  r235 — S4's fixtures set the SEQS, not the bare
      boolean. Setting only `order_placed` no longer refuses, so the check
      would fall through to the liquidity analysis and die on a None map — a
      red for the wrong reason, which is the CV.1 failure.
v1.0  2026-09-01  r207 — THE ORB FIRING SEQUENCE, PINNED BY EXECUTION.

Born red at f74818b (r206), where S1/S2/S3/S5/S6/S7/S8/S9/S10 all fail.

🔴 WHAT THIS EXISTS TO STOP, and it is not hypothetical. On 2026-09-01 QQQ
took TWO ORB shorts off ONE confirmed break+retest: 2 contracts at 1.56
stopped on the 25% floor, then 24 contracts at 1.15 — the exact premium the
first exited at — on the same tick, dead two minutes later on the structure
stop. Three separate defects had to line up:

  1. r195 removed `mark_triggered()` from the ORB dispatch and made
     `_orb_offer_working()` the duplicate suppressor. That reads a table
     PAPER NEVER WRITES, because `_place_single_leg` short-circuited to the
     paper filler above the standing-offer branch. Paper had no suppressor.
  2. `main.py` bound `orb = ctx["orb"]` at the top of the tick and dispatched
     on it at the bottom. `_rearm()` REPLACES ORBData, so after the exit the
     ctx reference was an orphan still reading OPEN_SHORT. r96's defect, at a
     different seam.
  3. The sizer measured the stop distance from the LIVE price, so the second
     fire — a few cents from its own invalidation — sized twelve times larger.

⚠️ EVERY CHECK BELOW THAT CAN EXECUTE, EXECUTES. WORKING_AGREEMENT 21: a test
that reads source text proves nothing about runtime, and 162 tests once passed
over a NameError that crash-looped the fleet. The three source-text checks
(S7/S8/S9) are pinned to CALL and BRANCH shapes via the AST, never to a string
that a comment could satisfy — WORKING_AGREEMENT 20.
