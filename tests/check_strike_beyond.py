tests/check_strike_beyond.py  v1.0
v1.0  2026-09-03  r233 — THE STRIKE MUST CLEAR THE TESTED RANGE, AND THE
      NEAREST LIVE LEVEL WINS. Operator, 2026-09-03: *"the strike cannot sit
      at any level that is part of the testing range... it has to be just
      beyond that, if only a little bit"*, and *"the level in question needs
      to be the closest to the current price."*

⚠️ EXECUTED, NEVER READ (WA §21). Every check drives `strike_beyond_sweep`
or the real selector and asserts on the returned strike. Asserting the source
contains `sweep_price` would have passed against the broken version, which
also contained it.

⚠️ THE DEEP-PIERCE FIXTURE IS THE HEADER'S OWN EXAMPLE, not one I invented
(WA §0.4): pool 7639.01 / extreme 7633 is the case `strike_beyond_sweep`
documents while contradicting its own stated intent one paragraph earlier.

Plain script, exit code, no pytest (§36 — the boxes' venv has none).
