"""tests/check_purge_lock.py — v1.0
v1.0  2026-09-05 — r256. MUTUAL EXCLUSION AND PARTIAL-FAILURE BEHAVIOUR,
DRIVEN AGAINST REAL PROCESSES AND A REAL LOCKED DATABASE.

🔴 WHAT IT PINS, AND ALL OF IT WAS MEASURED ON THE FLEET FIRST. On 2026-09-05
the conductor's purge phase and a hand-run `--apply` overlapped: four boxes
raised `sqlite3.OperationalError: database is locked` at `DELETE FROM candles`,
the exception escaped `purge()`, killed `main()`, and the RECLAIM never ran —
so those boxes kept their WALs while the eleven that got through returned
8.7 GB. `s3_push` has guarded every invocation path with `flock` since WH.6;
this file, which DELETES, had nothing.

⚠️ L1 TAKES THE LOCK IN A SECOND PROCESS, not by patching a flag. `flock` is
advisory and per-open-file-description — a same-process check would pass
against code that never locks at all, which is the shape of a test that proves
only that it agrees with itself (C.23).

⚠️ AND D1 HOLDS A REAL WRITE TRANSACTION rather than simulating a failure. The
whole finding is that SQLite's five-second default is shorter than one 2 GB
delete; asserting that with a stubbed exception would pin the handler and miss
the timeout, which is the half that actually bit.
