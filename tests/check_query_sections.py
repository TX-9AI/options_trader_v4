tests/check_query_sections.py  v1.1
v1.1  2026-09-01  r210 (chunk B) — TODAY-SCOPING AND WIDTH. Operator: PLANS,
      GATES and the closed-trade table to TODAY only, abbreviated, "it's
      spanning multi-line". Q7-Q11 added.
      🔑 ONE DEFINITION OF TODAY. r172 inlined the 09:30 cut inside
      show_decisions; gates and plans now need the same boundary, and three
      copies is three chances for two to disagree about what day it is.
      `session_start_epoch()` is extracted and Q7 pins that all three call it.
      🔴 AND THE `-4 hours` EDT HARDCODE WAS IN HERE TOO — the same class r125
      fixed in the otv4 sensors and dtp r236 found in standings.py (RPT.8).
      Q8 refuses its return.
v1.0  2026-09-01  r209 (chunk A) — WHAT THE BOX DASHBOARD IS FOR.

Operator, 2026-09-01, going through `query.py` from the bottom up: Live Levels
"don't care, take it out"; Performance by setup type "that's just trivia in my
opinion, useless by itself"; by setup grade "we don't have grades"; by strategy
"I don't need a per symbol snapshot of that"; all-time "irrelevant"; Character
"keep, but not in query.py — it belongs in status, below the pin line."

🔑 THE THROUGH-LINE IS SCOPE, NOT CLUTTER. This file is the PER-BOX report. An
all-time or by-strategy rollup computed from one symbol's trades.db is a slice
nobody acts on, and day_trader_pro's trade breakdown (r187) already does the
cross-fleet version properly — grouped by strategy, setup type, exit reason,
symbol, hour and weekday, with an ENGINE EPOCH floor.

🔴 AND ONE OF THEM WAS QUIETLY WRONG. `query.py` had no epoch filter at all, so
ALL-TIME PERFORMANCE pooled pre- and post-v4-split trades — 109 trades reaching
back through engines that no longer exist. r187 built the epoch floor for
exactly this contamination and this file never got it. Deleting the section
removes a wrong number, not merely a noisy one.

⚠️ BY SETUP GRADE WAS STRUCTURALLY EMPTY. r152 deleted the setup scorer and
every v4 write path hardcodes `UNGRADED`, so the section had one bucket and
could never have another.

⚠️ THIS IS A VIEW CHANGE, NOT A COLLECTOR CHANGE, and Q4 is what pins that.
`level_ledger` is a LIFECYCLE table — retention_purge excludes it in code
because a recomputation cannot rebuild a biography (r81) — and the sweep and
fork paths read it live. Removing the Live Levels PANEL must not remove a row.

Born red at 7722827 (r207), where Q1, Q2 and Q3 all fail.
