"""check_retention_armed.py — v1.1 (landed r162; R5 re-derived r278)

v1.1  2026-09-05 — r278. 🔴 R5 ASSERTED "VACUUM is still not EXECUTED at
      shutdown" AND r255 MADE THAT FALSE ON PURPOSE. It has been red since that
      afternoon and nothing noticed, because these checks only run when a
      `land.spec` names them. THIRD INSTANCE OF THIS CLASS IN ONE DAY — the
      conductor's C7 and the `head -3` truncation were the same shape; this one
      was missed because it lives in the other repo.
      🔑 The property being protected has not changed: **a vacuum must never
      stall the halt.** r255 enforces it by REFUSING when free disk is under the
      live size, rather than by the vacuum being absent. R5/R5b/R5c now pin
      that: it exists, it is gated, and a failure is reported rather than
      raised.

🔴 THE NIGHTLY PURGE MUST ACTUALLY DELETE.

`warehouse/retention_purge.py` shipped DRY BY DEFAULT, armed only by
`OT_RETENTION_APPLY=1`, pending a review of the policy numbers that was never
scheduled. `self_close` called `main([])` — an EMPTY argv, with no environment
set — so **the purge ran dry every night for two months, printed what it WOULD
delete, and deleted nothing.**

⚠️ THE COST, 2026-08-27: `feed_store.db` reached 1.5–1.8 GB per box, the 6.7
GiB roots hit 100%, and the fleet went blind MID-SESSION during RTH. QQQ and MU
crash-looped; recovering them cost their swapfiles, a failed VACUUM that left
the database LARGER, and a 14-box volume rebuild.

⚠️ AND IT WAS INVISIBLE BY CONSTRUCTION. A dry run logs the same line every
night at INFO. **Sixty identical log lines are indistinguishable from a job
that works** — nobody reads an unchanging line. Same failure class as the
pytest chain that was decorative for weeks and the tooling check that printed
green on a broken environment: a green light nobody read.

WHAT THIS PINS:
  R1  `self_close` passes `--apply` — arming is EXPLICIT at the call site, not
      ambient in an environment nobody sets.
  R2  `main()` honours it.
  R3  a hand-run is still DRY (a human must ask before deleting).
  R4  a dry purge with rows pending is LOUD, so the next silence is visible.

    # that FALSE on purpose: a gated vacuum now runs inside `reclaim()`. The

    # nothing runs these checks unless a `land.spec` names them.
    # ⚠️ THIRD INSTANCE OF THIS CLASS IN ONE DAY. The conductor's C7 pinned the
    # same retired rule and was re-derived when the reclaim was built; `head
    # -3` was the same shape; this one was missed because it lives in the OTHER
    # repo. A check that goes on certifying a rule the system has stopped
    # following is worse than no check — it reports green for a property that
    # is no longer true.

    # 🔑 WHAT THE ORIGINAL RULE WAS ACTUALLY PROTECTING, AND STILL IS: a vacuum
    # must never stall the halt. r162's cost is in this file's header — the
    # fleet went blind mid-session because the purge had run dry for two
    # months, and the recovery included a failed VACUUM that could not fit in
    # /tmp. So the property is not "no vacuum"; it is "no vacuum that cannot
    # complete", and r255 enforces it by REFUSING when free disk is under the
    # live size rather than by absence.
