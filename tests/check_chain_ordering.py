"""check_chain_ordering.py — v1.1
v1.1  2026-08-26  r146: C7-C11 re-pinned against the plan BOARD (derived/plans
      v2.0) after the seven builders were deleted. The property survives —
      no strategy may vanish from plan_tick — the mechanism is now NOT ASKED
      rows with the dispatcher's reason, plus the asked-and-silent canary.

🔴 THE 2026-08-26 SILENT FAILURE. The chain and GEX were fetched ~20 lines
BELOW `run_analysis()`, but the derived engines run INSIDE it. So every plan
builder hit its `chain is None` guard, `plans` came back empty on every tick,
`_write_tick` was never reached — and `plan_tick`/`plan_check` were never
CREATED. A full session produced nothing and looked, from outside, exactly like
an engine that was never registered.

⚠️ TWO INDEPENDENT DEFECTS, TWO INDEPENDENT PINS:
  C1-C4  the ORDERING — chain is fetched before run_analysis, published on ctx
         before the engines run, and NOT fetched twice.
  C5-C6  the VISIBILITY — tables are created at engine init, so an empty table
         says "ran, found nothing" instead of leaving a missing-table mystery.

    # cannot find the code it is pinning is not a pin.

    # matches its own DEFINITION (which sits earlier in the file than the call
    # site), and `fetch_chain()` has other legitimate callers. Both made the
