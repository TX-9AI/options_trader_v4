v1.1  2026-08-27  r165: runs the real prepare() instead of exec-ing a source slice. — v1.0

🔴 AN ORB INVALIDATED *BY RUNAWAY* IS RunawayContinuation'S TRIGGER, NOT A
DISQUALIFIER.

Measured live, NFLX 2026-08-27: price broke the ORB low 80.08 at 09:41 and ran
to the 50% TP at 79.52 with no retest — the textbook runaway. `orb_engine`
classified it exactly right (`state = INVALIDATED`, `invalidation_reason =
"runaway"`, `break_direction = "short"`). The strategy named after that setup
refused it with *"ORB state 'INVALIDATED' carries no direction."*

⚠️ THE CAUSE: direction was read by string-matching "LONG"/"SHORT" inside
`orb.state`. "INVALIDATED" contains neither, so the function returned at step 3
of its own checklist and never reached step 4, where `runaway_confirmed()`
would have confirmed the setup. The engine had already recorded the direction
in `break_direction` — a field the strategy never read.

⚠️ SAME CLASS AS `all()` vs `all_rails()` AND `oi` vs `open_interest`: reading a
plausible attribute instead of the one carrying the information. It costs more
here because it silently disables an entire strategy on exactly its own setup.

⚠️ `close_inside` MUST STILL REFUSE. That is the opposite tape — price came
back into the range — and is not a handoff.
