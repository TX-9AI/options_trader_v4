main.py  v4.20
v4.20 2026-08-27  r163 — THE TINES ARE MOVING LIQUIDITY LEVELS; THE DAILY FORK
      STRATEGY IS RETIRED. Operator, 2026-08-27: a tine is *"basically a
      moving level that sweep is allowed to use, but with a touch, not a
      reject"*, and *"it's allowed to be the 1st leg of a condor too, but
      again as a touch."* At the assembly point, right after the condor
      trigger map, `publish_tines` puts every active 1h/1d tine on the
      liquidity map as a MOVING named pool and emits a TOUCH event
      (liquidity_mapper v4.2); the sweep's plan (v4.7) prepares the spread
      beyond the touching move and fires leg one on the touch; leg two never
      selects a touch (a rejection is required). The daily-fork dispatch
      (plan cache, leg triggers, its own construction) is deleted along
      with strategy/daily_fork_credit_spread.py. main no longer overwrites
      the sweep signal's `condor_trigger_source` (a tine touch is classed
      `{tf}_fork`).
v4.19 2026-08-27  r161 — THE BUTTERFLY FIRES REGARDLESS OF OPEN POSITIONS.
      Operator, 2026-08-27: *"I want it to be able to fire regardless if any
      other open trades are found. Reason: it has such a high hurdle to
      clear. GEX pinning, pin reachable, economic feasibility. If it can
      achieve all that, it's earned an entry."* (TRADES.md §3 from r33: "no
      position slot, no capital, no competition".) main_loop now asks the
      butterfly's plan every tick of its slot in BOTH branches — position
      open or not — through `_attempt_butterfly()`, and a fire APPENDS its
      record (`add_open_position`, position_manager v4.4) instead of
      replacing the vertical under management. The execution tail of
      attempt_new_entry is factored into `_execute_entry_signal()` so both
      paths run the same sizing/entry/journal code; `additive=True` is the
      only difference. The condor's authorization no longer skips it.
v4.18 2026-08-27  r160 — THE CONDOR AUTHORIZES AND MANAGES; THE SWEEP PLANS AND
      EXECUTES LEG TWO. Operator, 2026-08-27: one vertical open -> only a
      complementary-side SWEEP is authorized, everything else gated off; the
      condor selects nothing; management begins once leg two is born (roll
      if threatened, tent if breached, close if uneconomical). The second-leg
      window is now: `authorize(open_sides)` -> `required_side` -> the
      sweep's own plan prepares and its spec fires. `plan_second_leg`,
      `leg2_fired`, the pairing-class computation and `required_level` are
      gone. Before the roll/tent execute, `manage()` writes the per-tick
      management row (which rung, what the next rung costs, does it clear)
      on the same numbers condor_roll is about to act on. Rule 4's pairing
      table collapses to sweep everywhere (the fork tine is acceptable for
      leg one; leg two is universally a sweep — the operator's 08-27 ruling).
v4.17 2026-08-26  r147 — THE SECOND-LEG WINDOW ROUTES THROUGH THE CONDOR'S
      ONE-LEVEL PLAN (`plan_second_leg`, iron_condor_strategy v4.6). The four
      direct second-leg attempts (1h fork on approach, 1d fork, sweep, TC.6)
      are removed from main_loop; their levels are candidates inside the
      plan, which fires only on a CONFIRMED REJECTION and moves to the next
      level on ACCEPTANCE. The Rule 4 pairing table is applied here, from
      leg one's trigger source, as the allowed level classes.
v4.16 2026-08-26  r146 — THE PLAN BOARD IS FED FROM DISPATCH. Every point where
      a strategy is NOT asked this tick (halted, outside the session, no
      chain, position open, ORB engine not confirmed, no runaway, slot
      claimed by an earlier strategy, DIRECTIONAL_ONLY, no 1d rails) tells
      `strategy.plan.skipped()` why, and `_safe_strategy` tells
      `strategy.plan.asked()` what was called — so `derived/plans.py` v2.0
      can write a NOT ASKED row for the silent strategies and flag any
      strategy that was asked and wrote nothing. The sweep now receives
      `orb_high`/`orb_low` (the r134 assembly-point values) for its
      session-map geometry check. Dispatch ORDER and every gate are
      unchanged; this narrates the decisions the chain already makes.
v4.15 2026-08-24  r112: DEBUG is a LIVE FLAG (data/DEBUG_LOG, devtools item 69),
      applied at import and on every tick — so it overrides however a box came
      to be in DEBUG, and removing it genuinely restores LOG_LEVEL. No restart,
      survives a bake, nothing git-tracked to edit.
v4.14 2026-08-24  r108: the pre-open rehearsal has a GO-RED TOGGLE (devtools
      item 68, mirroring the feed-maintenance window at 67). data/REHEARSAL_OFF
      on the box, read LIVE every pass, survives a bake. Inverted sense — the
      file's PRESENCE disables — so a fresh or forgotten box rehearses, and the
      menu line goes RED while it is OFF.
v4.13 2026-08-24  r106: the TENT is called after the roll (rung below it, only
      on an already-rolled + breached structure). CONDOR_TP_PCT retired, the
      stop written on every credit row is now the 15% floor the engine actually
      evaluates, and condor_leg_num is always 0 — "no condor implied, merely
      permitted", so there is no leg 1 and leg 2.
v4.12 2026-08-24  r105: the SECOND-LEG WINDOW tries all four credit triggers.
      Its own header said "all four triggers are eligible to fire the
      complementary side"; the code tried the two forks, so a sweep or TC.6
      first leg could never pair and the condor could only ever form from a
      fork. "A second leg is allowed, never expected" was true by omission.
v4.11 2026-08-24  r103: orb_state.json is READ at startup, authoritative
      (operator: "if it wrote it, trust it"), and written from the engine's own
      snapshot so writer and reader cannot drift. A resumed engine still owes a
      gap-fill replay. A MISSED confirmation is ADJUDICATED against the trades
      table before the row is closed — the tape cannot tell "never seen" from
      "taken and recorded before the process died" — and is journalled as a
      disposition with the setup's full geometry, like a decline.
v4.10 2026-08-24  r102: the r101 rehearsal stopped one call short — can_enter
      short-circuited on the RTH gate at DEBUG, so the outside-RTH pass reached
      no strategy (measured fleet-wide 16:53: decided=0 chain=0). attempt_new_entry
      now rehearses outside RTH and every skip on that path is INFO; the pass
      narrates START/STOPPED/END so silence stops being a valid outcome.
v4.9  2026-08-24  r101 DECIDE ALWAYS, PLACE AFTER 09:35 (operator directive).
      The trading half of the loop was never executed until the bell, so a box
      baked at 07:40 ran clean for two hours and died on its first decision at
      09:30:01. The pre-RTH branch now runs assemble_market_state +
      attempt_new_entry with live inputs, and a dispatch failure pages on the
      FIRST occurrence instead of the thirtieth. ENTRY_OPEN_ET gates the two
      order choke points; exits are never gated.
v4.8  2026-08-24  r99 — THREE DEFECTS THAT COST TRADES OR WOULD HAVE. (1) P0:
      `manage_open_position(ms=None)` — r65 renamed the retired label kwarg
      to `ms=` while deleting the parameter, so every tick with an open position
      raised TypeError into the loop catch-all and the loop sys.exit'd after 30
      of them. No position had been managed since 08-22; unseen because no fill
      happened. (2) The sweep credit spread claimed `signal` and went down the
      DEBIT dispatch (scorer, debit sizer, `_place_single_leg` buying its own
      short strike). It now routes pairing gate -> `_execute_condor_leg` like
      TC.6, carrying its own strategy name and its own 15% stop. (3) Credit
      verticals were flattened at 15:40 with the debits — VERTICAL_HOLD_TO_ET
      lived only in an evaluator this window never reached. flatten_all holds
      them to 15:45; a manage pass keeps the 15% floor live in between.
v4.7  2026-08-24  CONDOR REMODEL (v4.3): four independent credit-spread
      triggers (1h_fork, 1d_fork, sweep_reversal, trend_orb). Each vertical is
      standalone; second leg is allowed, never expected. Pairing gate enforces
      Rule 1 (max 2 open) and Rule 3 (never same side twice). CondorTriggerMap
      recomputes fork tines live each tick so trigger levels track the moving
      rail. DailyForkCreditSpread (new) adds the 1d pitchfork as a trigger.
      condor_trigger_source stamped on every credit spread for per-source
      grading. notify_leg_filled removed (no pairing expectation).
v4.6  2026-08-23  AUDIT F9: _safe_strategy reports a FIRE to the gate
      reporter, which is the only way a block ever clears (gate_report v4.1).
v4.5  2026-08-25  r65 EXORCISM: every mention of the retired classification
      system removed - identifiers, comments, docstrings, schema. The word
      does not appear in this tree. Full accounting: REMOVAL_LOG (delivery).

      measure's prior direction moves to BotState.prev_trend_direction,
      committed at the end of each analysis pass — the old carrier
      been a silent 0 and gap_class permanently UNDIRECTED since the split.
      The L1 sweep-score read is deleted for the same reason one level up:
      ctx["l1"] is set nowhere in v4, so the score was a silent 0.0 and the
      journal sections (7 sites), the chain_snapshot label pass, the
      two _L1_BREAKDOWN_FOR rows are removed; heartbeat and NO TRADE lines
      before dispatch on EVERY tick and the fleet traded NOTHING on its first
      stamp go with it. Nothing replaces them, deliberately.
Tick loop, context assembly, strategy dispatch. GATES STRIPPED - see ROADMAP Phase 2.

      the variable - v4 removed both engines it used to choose between - so the
      assert was a gate with no consumer that could only ever refuse to start.
      SMC fork's unit file. A guard outlives the thing it guarded.
v4.1  2026-08-20  AUDIT F4: relaxed_entry copied onto the condor-leg record -
      the tag was set on the signal and dropped before the insert.
v4.0  2026-08-19  Ported from options_trader_v3 at the OTV4 split.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
Dated release framing and trivia are stripped; what remains is the
reasoning behind the thresholds, the design guarantees, and the
defects that recur when forgotten. WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires
this block be read before the file is edited.

main.py — options_trader v6.19
ORB IS BLOCKED UNDER RANGING (operator direction; that
       cell is the conclusive loss leader). Mirrored from options_trader_smc
       so the A/B arms stay comparable. The refusal journals as
       `gate_block:orb_ranging` rather than being a silent absence. Leading
       branch with the existing ladder moved to `elif`, so RANGING is refused
       it. OT_ORB_BLOCK_RANGING=0 restores the old behaviour.
🔴 P0 HOTFIX — run_analysis raised NameError on EVERY tick.
       v6.16 (Level.1) and v6.17 (A2.6b) write ctx["gap"], ctx["gap_pct"] and
       ctx["level_near"] into `ctx`, but run_analysis did not bind that name
       until its return statement. The NameError raised inside the try; the
       except handler's own ctx["gap"] = None then re-raised it UNCAUGHT. Net
       strategy evaluation — the bot trades nothing and the failure is a
       traceback per tick, not a quiet degradation. `ctx` is now bound before
       the Level.1/A2.6b blocks, which write into it; macro/orb are added at
       the single return. NO OTHER BEHAVIOUR CHANGES in this version.
       Found 2026-08-18 during the SMC-fork salvage and reproduced
       behaviourally before the fix; same class as WA §21's
       is_trend_participation NameError — invisible to py_compile.
A2.6b: MEASURE the overnight gap instead of inheriting it
        as an anonymous ATR spike. `atr_series` uses true range with prev_close
        and the 5m tape is continuous, so a large gap spikes ATR at the open and
        decays - every consumer sees a volatility number that is partly last
        night's news and CANNOT TELL WHICH PART. Nowhere was the gap measured
        as itself.
        THE ONLY PRE-OPEN DECISION-TIME INPUT IN THE STACK: ADX, conviction,
        is fully formed at 09:30 before a single RTH bar prints.
        not bound this early in the tick, and a bare getattr would have raised
        into the except and pinned prior_dir=0 forever - making gap_class
        permanently "UNDIRECTED". A silent constant is the failure this whole
        week has been about.
        CLASSIFICATION IMPORTED from tests/gap_backfill.py, never
        reimplemented (7) - and gap_pct is a REAL column with a NULL default,
        because a gap of exactly zero is a real reading.
Level.1: GRADED LEVEL STRENGTH, FOR EVERY STRATEGY.
        `level_strength` measured 94% ties on TWO unique values. Two causes,
        both collection defects:
        (1) the formula was min(1.0, (0.6 if named else 0.2) +
            min(touch_count,4)*0.1) and TOUCH_COUNT IS A CONSTANT - named pools
            hardcode it to 1 and nothing increments it (44,450 of 44,890 ticks
            read exactly 1), so it only ever produced 0.7 or 0.3.
        (2) only `sweep_reversal` wrote it, and sweep is hard-gated with a 0.4%
            live win rate - so 94% of the book carried the column default.
            THE PROBE NEVER MEASURED LEVELS; IT MEASURED AN EMPTY COLUMN.
        Now graded by TYPE with a rung discount (analysis/level_grade.py), and
        `ctx["level_near"]` puts the nearest graded pool in front of EVERY
        strategy each tick. `swept_level_name` had no writer either and now
        does.
        GRADES ARE STATED PRIORS, NOT FITTED - ordering follows resting
        liquidity. Fitting on P&L would repeat the grade inversion (A-grade
        -$8,244 vs B +$1,893).
        UNBLOCKED BY LIQ.6 (rung in the name) AND FEED.2 (ON High/Low real).
STR.2: carry `flat_angle_deg` from the L1 breakdown onto
        attribute - so trades.flat_angle_deg came back 100% tied on ONE unique
        value and the separation probe read it as a measured zero.
        on every RANGING/COMPRESSION evaluation and lands in the breakdown as
        {"angle": ...}. COMPUTED, RECORDED IN THE EVIDENCE, NEVER DELIVERED -
        the same shape as `direction_conf`. Third instance of that class in a
        week.
        THE SENTINEL IS -1.0, NOT 0.0: zero degrees IS the flattest possible
        reading, so a 0.0 default is indistinguishable from a genuinely flat
        tape - exactly the confusion that produced the bug.
        WHY IT MATTERS MOST: the angle is a STRUCTURAL read, not a magnitude
        one - slope of the recent window in ATR units, the closest thing
        collected to "is price going anywhere or just rotating".
        L1 score vector, via `_l1_scores(ctx)` reading `ctx["l1"].scores`
        defensively. Emission only - no gate, no size, no behaviour change.
        A malformed ctx returns None and the axes are simply ABSENT, which is
        distinguishable downstream from zero; a 0.0 default would not be.
TCS.4: THE FIRST TC.6 TRADE THAT FORMED CORRECTLY DIED AT
        THE WRITE, AND CRASH-LOOPED A LIVE BOX. `_execute_condor_leg` set
        `is_trend_credit` on the record; `log_entry` INSERTs every record key;
        the field has NO COLUMN. OperationalError on the INSERT -> loop error
        cap -> service shutdown -> restart -> again, every 15s for the rest of
        NFLX's session.
        IT NEVER FIRED BEFORE because TC.6 could never REACH execution - TCS.3
        fixed the bound at noon and exposed it hours later. A latent defect
        surfaced by a fix.
        WHY THE FIELD EXISTED (checked before removing): `ed9d30a` (08-13) made
        it the EXIT ENGINE'S DISCRIMINATOR - `if bool(record.get(
        "is_trend_credit"))` routed TC.6 to breach-or-nickel. On 08-14 it was
        found not to be a column, so every restart lost it and the branch
        silently stopped firing; `structure.py` was built to replace it by
        DERIVING from persisted `strategy`/`setup_type`. The read side moved.
        The write side was never cleaned up. It is vestigial, not spurious.
        WHY REMOVED AND NOT ADDED AS A COLUMN: WORKING_AGREEMENT 22, written on
        08-14 about THIS FIELD - "PREFER DERIVING. A new column fixes tomorrow
        and not today: every position opened before the migration still
        rehydrates without it, SELECT * returns None, and None reads as False -
        the exact failure, silently."
        THE SIGNAL ATTRIBUTE `sig.is_trend_credit` IS UNTOUCHED - in-memory
        only, read via getattr to set `_is_tcs`, never persisted.
TCS.3: THE BOUND OUTLIVED ITS FRAME. `_opening_range`
        read the 60-bar 1m cache and the 09:30-09:35 bars leave that window
        at ~10:35 ET — 25 minutes before TCS_START_ET — so trend
        participation (TC.6) was structurally unable to fire: the bound was
        None for the entire credit window on every box since d12ee3e baked
        (Fri 08-14). Fleet-verified before fixing (13/15 boxes logging
        `[tcs] no opening-range`, up to 290/290 evaluated ticks). The range
        now reads TODAY'S 09:30 5m bar (exact for a 5-minute window, present
        all session on every tape), with the 1m window kept for the early
        session and non-5m window sizes; both paths date-filtered. Same
        failure class as AUDIT A2.1, one function over: a lookback written
        against history the frame does not carry.
        NOTE: FEED.2 (2026-08-15) edited this file (_EXT preference in
        _named_level_frame) without a title bump — recorded here so the
        version history stays truthful; no behaviour change beyond FEED.2's
        own.
AUDIT A2: four fixes from adversarial audit #2.
        (A2.1) named levels get a DEEP frame: `_named_level_frame()` reads the
        candle store directly (1h bars, NAMED_FRAME_1H_BARS, 300s TTL) and is
        passed to the mapper as `named_df` - the cached 5m frame is 100 bars
        (~8.3h) and was feeding the 10-day section lookback truncated tape:
        wrong pool prices, rungs mutating intraday. Store precedent is PF.2
        ("the history was never missing - the frame was"). Fails soft to the
        old behavior (mapper guards truncation on any input).
        (A2.2) the F5 orphan announcement MOVED to the manage branch. Its old
        home, `_condor_leg_open_without_plan`, is only called inside
        attempt_new_entry, which only runs when has_open_position() is False -
        and that falls back to the SAME get_open_trades(). While an orphan leg
        was open the call site was unreachable; when reachable, the count was
        by construction zero. The v6.10/v4.83 danger model (TC.6 opening a
        second spread against an orphan) was impossible for the same reason -
        the fix guarded a scenario the gate already forbids, with a guard the
        gate made unreachable, and the once-per-restart WARNING could never
        fire. It now fires from the has_open_position branch, where an open
        leg can actually be seen. The checker itself is now side-effect-free
        and stays as belt-and-braces on the TC.6 dispatch.
        (A2.4) ledger bar selection moved into the ledger: feed_frame() walks
        every closed session bar newer than the persisted last_bar_ts - the
        old iloc[-2] + one-stamp guard silently DROPPED bars on any tick
        slower than ~75s, undercounting exactly the busy tape.
        (A2.9) an empty first-tick seed no longer latches the date - the
        ledger retries seeding until the mapper produces named pools; and the
        wiring routes through get_ledger() so there is ONE singleton, not two.
AUDIT F6: A TC.6 RECORD IS NOT A CONDOR LEG.
        `_execute_condor_leg` still stamped is_condor_leg=1 and
        condor_leg_num=2 onto every trend credit spread, called
        notify_leg_filled() on its fill (advancing a condor plan state machine
        the trade has nothing to do with — a no-op today only because TC.6
        defers whenever a plan is active: a gate, not a guarantee), and sent a
        Telegram entry alert advertising a stop for a trade whose record
        deliberately carries stop_premium=0.0 — a lie on the exact channel
        that caught the last identity bug. All three now condition on _is_tcs.
        The two persisted fields were spoofing `_condor_sibling_open` (an
        opposite-side open TC.6 would make a standalone condor leg read
        "formed": ratchet and TP suppressed) and `condor_roll`'s leg discovery
        (could have closed a TC.6 leg as rolled_to_broken_wing).
        ⚠️ position_manager v3.2 lands in the SAME commit: its premium fetch
        keyed on is_condor_leg, which this change removes from TC.6 rows —
        without v3.2 the spread pricing silently falls to the single-leg path.
        That pairing is the hop this fix would have broken if shipped alone.
TC.6 IDENTITY THROUGH THE EXECUTION PATH.
        `_execute_condor_leg` hardcoded condor identity onto every record it
        built, so `is_trend_credit` and `underlying_stop` never reached the
        trade and the exit branch gated on them COULD NEVER FIRE. Every trend
        credit spread inherited the condor ratchet and the 25%% premium stop.
        is_trend_credit, and stop_premium=0 for a trend credit spread.
`_opening_range()`: the ORB high/low recomputed FROM THE
        TAPE as trend PARTICIPATION's bound. Separates the ORB ENGINE (no
        runaway gate, no slot arbitration past 11:00) from the ORB LEVEL (a
        price, not a dependency). Restart-proof and available past the cutoff.
AFD.1 MOVED TO PRE-DISPATCH. It was a POST-SELECTION veto,
        so past 11:00 a debit strategy still WON the slot: `signal` went
        non-None, TC.6 (behind `if signal is None`) never ran, and the debit
        signal was refused afterwards — **the tick produced NO trade and the
        afternoon slot was consumed by a strategy forbidden to trade in it.**
        Likely the real reason TC.6 fired zero times on 2026-08-14, independent
        of the runaway gate. ORB / Continuation / Sweep are now SKIPPED, not
        evaluated-then-refused. The post-selection gate is retained as defence
        in depth.
TC.6 v2.0 call site: no `orb`, pass `trend`. The runaway
        gate was slot arbitration, not anchoring — after 11:00 ORB owns nothing.
TC.6 WIRED. TrendCreditSpread dispatches after the condor
        and routes through `_execute_condor_leg`, deferring when a condor plan
        holds the symbol. Exit is BREACH-OR-NICKEL via `is_trend_credit`
        (exit_engine v4.17) — the measured +$0.52/spread was HELD TO EXPIRY,
        UNMANAGED, so the ratchet and 25%% stop are deliberately unreachable.
PF.5 WIRED. The condor now consults the DAILY pitchfork and
        the session extremes. `_condor_rails()` returns the rails or None, and
        **None means NO CONDOR** — operator: "consider the condor off the table
        if we don't have guardrails. That is the insurance policy that
        eliminates a bad decision in an unpredictable session." Measured cost on
        2026-08-12: 13 distinct daily forks across 7 of 15 boxes, so roughly
        half the fleet becomes condor-ineligible. Accepted.
        `_session_extremes()` takes the max across BOTH frames — each is a
        rolling window and neither is guaranteed to reach 09:30. A late window
        UNDERSTATES the extreme, which loosens the filter rather than tightening
        it, so the failure direction is a missed rejection not a wrong one; the
        strategy logs a missing extreme as a plumbing fault rather than trading
        with the filter silently off.
        This is the pitchfork overlay's FIRST CONSUMER — it has been live as a
        weight-0 observer since 2026-08-12 with one call site and nothing
        reading the rails back.
AFTERNOON DEBIT BLOCK. Operator: "The only other Long that
        can fire is either part of a butterfly or an iron condor vertical
        spread from 11 o'clock onwards." ORB/Continuation/SweepReversal are
        refused past DEBIT_DIRECTIONAL_CUTOFF_ET (11:00 ET, env-tunable).
        PLACED AFTER THE SIGNAL IS CHOSEN, not at dispatch: one gate instead of
        three, so a strategy added later cannot silently bypass the rule; the
        refused signal is fully formed so the journal records WHAT WAS REFUSED
        (a gate that vetoes invisibly can never be calibrated from its own
        rejections — the reasoning that put gates E and F after the score in
        setup_scorer); and condor legs never reach it, having routed through
        `_execute_condor_leg` above, so the credit path is exempt BY
        CONSTRUCTION rather than by a list entry that could rot.
        ENTRIES ONLY — open positions manage normally.
        ⚠️ IN A TRENDING AFTERNOON THIS LEAVES NOTHING: the condor self-gates to
        RANGING and the butterfly needs PINNING GEX. That window belongs to the
        trend credit spread (TC.6), which is NOT BUILT. Dark on purpose until
        it is — the measured cost of that window is negative.
RGM.6: THE FALLBACK RESOLVES TO A KNOWN LABEL.
        Operator: "unknown should be virtually eliminated by the time we freeze
        layer 1… there should be ways to extrapolate and resolve to a KNOWN
        label." The diary sizes it exactly: **L1 is all-zero on only 2.4-3.0% of
        ticks on EVERY session since 07-15**, while the v13 fallback emitted
        UNKNOWN on ~18-19%. A known answer existed roughly SEVEN TIMES more
        often than we were genuinely blind, and it was discarded.
        v5.0's hold covered STALE ticks. The other fall-through — the code's own
        "empty committed label on a WARM book" — went straight to v13, which
        re-derives from scratch with NO MEMORY and says UNKNOWN when nothing
        matches its ladder.
        THE LADDER IS NOW: committed L2 -> held incumbent -> **L1 ARGMAX** ->
        v13. UNKNOWN is reserved for the ~2.4% that are genuinely all-zero.
        ⚠️ CONVICTION IS CARRIED, NOT INVENTED. An L1-argmax label carries L1's
        RAW score, which is below theta_commit by construction — that is the
        point. Downstream gates that read conviction see a weak label as weak.
        ⚠️ THE ENGINE TAG IS NOW FOUR STATES: [L2 c=] committed, [L2-hold c=]
        incumbent, [L1 c=] argmax, [v13] true fallback. `grep -c '[v13]'` has
        been the fallback-rate measure all week — with the split, a DROP in it
        must not be read as a fix when it is a relabelling.
        ⚠️ EXPECT UNKNOWN TO FALL TOWARD ITS ~2.4% FLOOR and the labelled
        therefore NOT poolable across this deploy.
        Kill switch: OT_RGM6_L1_ARGMAX=0 restores the pre-RGM.6 ladder exactly.
v6.0
CNT.6: CONTINUATION IS BLOCKED IN RANGING AND COMPRESSION.
        A trend continuation is a trend RESUMING after a pullback. RANGING and
        COMPRESSION are the assertion that there is no trend to continue, so the
        entry contradicts its own premise — this is a correctness defect, not a
        permissiveness setting.
        ⚠️ THE MECHANISM WAS THE `_is_runaway` BYPASS. The gate read
        runaway ORB flag skipped the label check entirely and continuation fired
        on ANY tape at Priority 2 — ahead of Butterfly (P3, RANGING/COMPRESSION)
        and Condor (P4, RANGING), both behind `if signal is None` and therefore
        never evaluated. The operator saw it as condors and butterflies going
        extinct; the cause was a dispatch bypass, not an absence of setups.
        MEASURED, 13 sessions: RANGING → Continuation 94 vs IronCondor 27 ·
        COMPRESSION → Continuation 39 vs Butterfly 6. Continuation took 3.5x the
        strategies exist for.
        ⚠️ WHY IT IS IN DISPATCH AND NOT IN THE STRATEGY: CNT.3 already blocked
        the COMPRESSION handoff INSIDE continuation_strategy and the squeeze
        continued, because a strategy-level veto still CONSUMES THE SLOT on its
        way to returning None. Only a gate above the call frees P3/P4.
        ⚠️ EXPECT FEWER CONTINUATION TRADES AND THE RETURN OF BUTTERFLY/CONDOR.
        Do not read the drop in continuation volume as a regression — it is the
        change working. Kill switch: OT_CONT_BLOCK_PREMIUM=0.
        SEPARATE AND NOT ADDRESSED HERE: RANGING is emitted on only ~2% of L2
        ticks, so the condor is ALSO starved by the label itself. Freeing the
        slot is necessary but not sufficient for condor volume.
L1 EVIDENCE ON THE FIRED DISPOSITION. The sweep collection
        is meant to characterise what made a good ENTRY good, and the journal
        contributing term that decided the entry was computed at the fire and
        then discarded. Reconstructing them later means replaying the tape and
        hoping the replayed score matches the one that fired, which is an
        approximation sitting exactly where the analysis lives. Now records the
        six-score vector on every fire, plus the firing setup's own L1
        breakdown via `_L1_BREAKDOWN_FOR`.
        ⚠️ A WRONG MAPPING IS SILENT — it files a well-formed breakdown from the
        an unmapped strategy records no breakdown rather than a wrong one.
        Log-only: no gate, no dispatch and no sizing reads any of this.
MEM.2: in-process tracemalloc, gated by OT_MEM_TRACE.
        The standalone probe failed FOUR times in an afternoon and never once
        for a reason about memory — wrong box, un-pulled file, `tmux sh -c`
        inheriting neither .bashrc nor the unit environment (so no credentials
        and OT_INSTRUMENT defaulting to QQQ on the SPX box), and finally an
        `xargs env` workaround that echoed every secret to the terminal. All
        four are the same root cause: a second process cannot easily inherit the
        trading environment. **The bot already has it.**
        Costs one bool test per tick when off; tracemalloc is not even imported.
        ⚠️ When ON it adds ~10-30% memory overhead, which on a 951 MB box is
        itself a risk — enable on the RESIZED SPX box only, never fleet-wide.
CNT.1: CONTINUATION DISPATCH OPENED TO BREAKOUT_VOLATILE.
        Operator's call, to gather data. The bar was structural, not a quality
        judgement: continuation derives DIRECTION from the label, and
        BREAKOUT_VOLATILE asserts volatility expansion without saying which way,
        so no branch could assign one. continuation_strategy now takes direction
        from `trend.overall_direction` when the label is BREAKOUT, gated on
        `primary_adx >= CONT_BREAKOUT_MIN_ADX` (default 25) — an ADX bar rather
        than a conviction bar, because under a non-trending label continuation's
        conviction floor is skipped and BREAKOUT's conviction is not the trend's.
        Entries are tagged `trend_continuation_breakout` so the cross-day rollup
        scores this path separately from _standalone and _handoff.
        Kill switch: OT_CONT_BREAKOUT_DIRECTION=0.
        ruling — sweep is an EVENT, not a market state. The dispatch required
        of live ticks, is exactly zero on 96%, and F7's commit threshold made it
        rarer still. Dispatch now gates on the L1 `_sweep` SETUP SCORE
        (>= SWEEP_SETUP_FLOOR), captured from the confluence result this loop
        already computes. The score's three hard vetoes ARE the stated spec:
        named level, rejected back through, not accepted beyond. The PLTR
        trend-opposition guard is a soft-necessary INSIDE that score, so it
        survives the change — it never lived in this gate.
LIVE A/B ON THE EMISSION LAW (RGM.1 F7). conviction_
        integrator v2.1 closes the unprotected branch: below theta_hold the
        incumbent was replaced by bare argmax every tick, which accounted for
        96.9% of 8,345 label switches across 19 sessions at a median incumbent
        conviction of 0.08. v2.1 now runs BOTH laws on every tick and reports
        whenever the divergence CHANGES (never per tick). Nothing reads the
        shadow to trade. Kill switch: OT_L2_PROTECT_BELOW_HOLD=0 restores the
        v2.0 law exactly, and the shadow then models v2.1 — so the A/B reads
        the same in either direction and one env var runs the control.
ORB WAS BEING GATED BY THE STALE-BOOK ENTRY BLOCK, AND THAT
        WAS NEVER INTENDED. v5.0 put the block ABOVE the dispatch, so it
        provide — became unreachable on a stale tick. MEASURED, not inferred:
        the block ran 09:35:01 → 09:39-09:41 ET on ALL 15 boxes on 2026-08-04,
        which is the first four to six minutes of ORB's own entry window (ORB
        opens 09:35:00 sharp). Every session since v5.0 deployed lost that
        window fleet-wide, and the flagship is the strategy the morning belongs
        to.
        A CONFIRMED ORB (OPEN_LONG / OPEN_SHORT) is now exempt. Nothing else is:
        continuation, condor, butterfly and sweep all condition on the label and
        stay blocked, so v5.0's actual protection is intact.
        own guard, latch and pager. A confirmed ORB break on a stale book reads
        fresh price and no label at all.
W.2: _capture_entry_snapshot's handler now logs inside the
        except itself. It always warned, but the census reads the HANDLER BODY,
        so it was counted SILENT — and a census that miscounts is worse than
        none. No behaviour change.
        v5.1 blocked ENTRIES on stale and held the committed label, but a HELD
        any label that is not TRENDING in the trade's direction, so a position
        could still be closed on a classification the engine could not confirm
        at that moment. And on a COLD book — stale with nothing committed —
        main fell back to v1.3 raw argmax, which is the churn L2 exists to
        before any price stop. That is the 07-23..08-03 flicker mechanism with
        one branch left open.
        so None disables exactly those three and nothing else.
        EVERY PRICE-BASED EXIT STILL RUNS: 15:45 hard close, stop, max_loss,
        trail, FVG trail, break-of-structure, condor ratchet, nickel close,
        the price feed is down, and refusing to stop out on it would be a
        different and worse rule. A 0DTE position must still flatten at 15:45.
ENTRY SNAPSHOT HOOK (log-only, freeze-safe). Every confirmed
        fill — directional and both condor legs — now persists the entry-time
        FVG/structure picture to trades.entry_snapshot via
        analysis/entry_snapshot.py. Runs AFTER the record is written, so it
        cannot reach the entry decision, the size, the strike or any exit; the
        only thing it can do to a live position is nothing.
        WHY HERE AND NOT IN entry_engine: one call site per path, in the file
        that owns ctx, and it keeps a second lineage out of another agent's
        file (working agreement §7). The condor helper gains an optional ctx
        for the same reason — both of its callers already hold one.
        THE CAPTURE'S OWN FAILURE IS AUDIBLE. set_entry_snapshot returns a
        boolean and the payload carries `err`; a miss logs once per reason per
        process (the _log_backfill_depth idiom, §17) rather than every fill or
        never. A snapshot hook that fails silently would leave a column of
        NULLs indistinguishable from a day with no trades — which is the exact
        shape of every observability defect this repo has paid for.
DISPATCH ISOLATION. Each strategy evaluation now runs inside
        _safe_strategy(): a raise is logged at ERROR and returns None, so the
        priority cascade continues instead of aborting the tick. Before this, one
        strategy raising silently disabled every strategy BELOW it — butterfly's
        `_mult` NameError (Priority 3) suppressed the iron condor (Priority 4) on
        every RANGING/COMPRESSION tick where GEX was pinning, and nothing in any
        log said the condor had been skipped. Applies to all six dispatch call
        sites plus the Leg-2 check in the tick loop.
STOP TRADING ON THE UN-SMOOTHED CLASSIFIER. Two rules, no
        new parameter, nothing to tune.
        FALLBACK was wrong. On a stale tick the bot dropped to the v1.3
        classifier — raw L1 argmax — which is precisely the churn L2 exists to
        remove (436 committed switches vs 695 argmax flips). exit_engine checks
        median hold 0.8 min and p25 12 SECONDS, against 5-12 min for every other
        exit reason; 19% of continuation exits and 27% of iron-condor exits.
        A 12-second position has not had time to be right or wrong — only to pay
        a round trip. And the trigger is routine: v4.6's own note records that
        "a tick gap over dt_max=90s re-stales every tick".
        THE FIX: (a) on a stale tick WITH a committed label, HOLD that label
        instead of falling back; (b) take NO NEW ENTRIES while stale. Holding is
        declining to act on unknown information — the position stays protected
        by every price-based stop, none of which read the label. Entering is a
        DECISION and is refused.
        A COLD BOOK AT THE OPEN STILL FALLS BACK TO v1.3 — that path was always
        correct (no prior state exists to hold) and is unchanged.
        WHY THIS MATTERS EVEN THOUGH LOSSES ARE ACCEPTABLE RIGHT NOW: the fleet
        is deliberately permissive to collect a broad sample. A flickered exit
        does not just cost $48, it writes a row tagged
        "ContinuationStrategy / TRENDING / -$48" that will later be counted as
        evidence about an exit mechanism. The fix does not reduce firing; it
        stops premature exits, so each trade actually expresses its setup.
DECLARE THE OPENING GAP, AND STAMP THE ENGINE.
        (a) The first ~25 minutes of every session legitimately cannot produce
        RANGING or COMPRESSION: both are computed on a 25-bar 1-MINUTE window,
        and market_data deliberately scopes the 1m frame to the current session
        (OT_FEED_INTRADAY_SCOPE=session) so it can never bleed across the
        overnight gap and fabricate a slope. v4.6 announced that designed
        condition at WARNING as "NOT L2.5-grade" and fired it on 13 of 15 boxes
        at 09:30 on 2026-07-30. It now logs INFO ("warming as designed", naming
        the dims and the frame depth) when ONLY window-dependent dims are missing
        AND the frame is still filling, and keeps the WARNING — now carrying
        df_1m — for every other starve, which really is a fault. Deliberately NOT
        fixed by padding the frame (that is what the guard prevents) nor by
        fabricating a low value (synthetic data would enter the calibration set)
        nor by weakening the integrator's full-vector invariant.
        [L2 c=..]/[v13] tag in bot.log — which is why "has L2.5 ever committed?"
        took a fleet-wide grep across 138k-line logs. It also makes the designed
        v1.3 opening window excludable from L2-conditioned fits by a WHERE
        clause instead of by inference. Auto-migrates via ALTER TABLE (v-obs
        pattern); observability only, no trade-mechanics change.
**L2.5 WAS NEVER REACHABLE.** Root cause of every symptom
        and BOTH gates compared it to the uppercase literal "L2" — at the tick
        override (was line 482) and at the startup warm-load (was 1749). "l2" ==
        "L2" is False, so the L2.5 block has never executed on any box since
        v4.0 wired it, and no environment variable could have helped because the
        DEFAULT itself failed the comparison. This is why a fleet-wide grep of
        34k-138k-line bot.logs on all 29 boxes returned L2=0, FAILED=0, STALE=0
        and integrator_state.json had never been written: nothing inside the
        block — commit, save, load, even the failure handler — was ever reached.
        The v4.5 import fix and v4.6 observability were both real and both
        irrelevant to reachability. Fixed by comparing lowercase at both sites,
        plus a start-up assert that refuses to boot on an unrecognised value
        rather than silently selecting an engine nobody chose, and a start-up log
        line naming the active engine so "which engine is running?" is answerable
THE SILENT L2 GATE IS NOW AUDIBLE. v4.5 fixed the import,
        and a probe against the real classes confirmed L2 commits from tick 1
        on a full evidence vector (TRENDING_BULL, conviction 0.984). But three
        conditions must hold for L2 to override v1.3, and only two of them
        silent. Since ConvictionIntegrator clears `stale` ONLY when every
        dimension of the evidence vector is non-None, one perpetually-None
        [v13] with no warning anywhere — which is exactly why "did L2.5 land?"
        was unanswerable from the logs. The non-committing branch now reports
        the reason and names the missing dimensions, throttled to one line per
        change, and announces recovery when it starts committing again. Known
        starvation paths: closes=None (df_1m shorter than RANGE_WINDOW_BARS)
        nulls RANGING+COMPRESSION; a tick gap over dt_max=90s re-stales every
        tick. Observability only — no change to trading behaviour.
L2.5 IMPORT CONTRACT FIXED + SILENT DEGRADATION MADE LOUD.
        `RANGE_WINDOW_BARS` was imported from conviction_integrator, which does
        only ever reachable through a re-export tuple that the 07-28 excavation
        trimmed. The ImportError was swallowed by the L2 guard, so all 15 boxes
        ran the v1.3 classifier for the whole 07-29 session while logging a
        single WARNING per start. Two changes: (a) both symbols now import from
        the modules that OWN them — a re-export is not a contract; (b) the
        fallback logs at ERROR and pages via
        silent engine swap invalidates the session's conviction data for
        calibration even though trading continues unaffected. The pager is
        itself wrapped — it can never take the bot down.
READINESS STAGED PICKS (trade_readiness v1.1, LOG-ONLY):
        while ARMED, continuation/sweep now journal the contract they WOULD
        select via the live selector on SMOOTHED conviction — the calm-vs-
        spike strike experiment. Constructor passes contract_ctx. No entry
        path touched.
TRADE READINESS wired in (LOG-ONLY). New
        analysis/trade_readiness.py evaluates every strategy's pre-trigger
        confluence as a graded readiness R in [0,1] each ~15s tick, with a
        dt-aware slope (R/minute) and a DORMANT->STAGING->ARMED machine that
        journals transitions, heartbeats, and readiness_would_fire moments.
        Gates NOTHING — no fire decision changes anywhere; guarded import
        (loop byte-identical without it), assess errors swallowed. Hooked in
        the every-tick block beside the chain snapshot, deliberately BEFORE
        the has_open_position branch so observation continues while halted or
        holding. ORB exempt (mechanical by directive). This is the sight-
        picture groundwork: where the market IS (instant geometry), where
        it's BEEN (L2 conviction), where it's HEADING (slope on the lowest
        timeframe). Log-only per the pitchfork weight-0 precedent so it rides
        inside the frozen-baseline window; its journal rows calibrate the
        bars that will eventually gate.
FULL OPTION-CHAIN ARCHIVAL (analysis/chain_snapshot.py).
        The bot already fetched the complete 0DTE chain every ~15s tick — bid,
        ask, mark, delta, gamma, theta, vega, IV, OI, volume on every strike,
        ~23,000 full-chain snapshots per fleet-day — and discarded all of it
        except the one selected contract in the signal_journal `scored` event
        (which drops gamma and vega besides). Chains are NOT reconstructible
        after the session: unlike the 1-min tape or deterministic swing pivots,
        a quote for a strike nobody selected is gone permanently at 16:00.
        Now archived to data/chain_snapshots/<date>/<SYM>.jsonl.gz on a
        wall-clock cadence (OT_CHAIN_SNAPSHOT_MIN, default 5). Log-only, gates
        nothing, adds NO fetch. Makes any future strike-selection rule
        retroactively testable instead of a live experiment.
PAPER CONDOR CREDIT via the shared authority (audit
        defect T). The condor leg paper fill applied PAPER_FILL_SLIPPAGE_PCT
        inline while single-leg and butterfly entries had moved to booking the
        bare mark (entry_engine v3.8), so paper friction differed BY STRATEGY.
        It now calls execution/limit_ladder.paper_fill_credit(), the one
        paper-pricing authority, which honours the same knob for every path
        (default 0.0 = book the mark, matching the mid-credit limit live
        actually posts). No live-path change.
        integrator's committed label (Layer-1 confluence evidence → integrator),
        replacing the v1.3 boolean classifier's raw argmax as the trade gate.
        Cures the fleet-wide UNKNOWN flicker (v1.3 dropped to UNKNOWN mid-trend
        at avg ADX ~29 — a hard no-trade gate firing during the strongest
        drops (theta_hold hysteresis) and never emits UNKNOWN. Gates run WIDE
        OPEN (conviction logged, not gated — L3 tunes bars later); paper P&L is
        (data/integrator_state.json), warm-loaded at boot. Rollback:
SIGNAL JOURNAL DISPOSITIONS (ROADMAP Phase 3.1, log-only,
        zero behavior change): attempt_new_entry now emits what happened to
        every signal AFTER scoring — `disposition` events for fired /
        sizing_rejected / invalid_signal (below-B REJECTs are already emitted
        by setup_scorer v1.3's `scored` event) — plus `condor_plan` /
        condor bypasses the score path, so without these its conviction bar
        could never be calibrated). ORB dispositions carry retest_depth_px
        (orb_engine v3.7, defect G) and its ATR-relative form. All emissions
        route through analysis/signal_journal (guarded import, every failure
        swallowed) — the trading loop is byte-identical if the journal is
        absent or broken.
pass df_5m through to position management so exit trails
        anchor to 5-minute FVGs (exit_engine v3.8 runner refinements).
CONDOR ENTRY FILL-CONFIRMATION (audit defect O, part 1).
        _execute_condor_leg live path now confirms the fill before ANY record
        exists: submit the signed-credit limit → poll via
        execution/order_confirm.confirm_order_fill (bounded by
        LIVE_ENTRY_DEADLINE_SECONDS) → book ONLY confirmed contracts at the
        broker's per-leg net credit. Unfilled → cancel, walk away, no ghost;
        partial → book the filled size; uncancellable → page, reconcile adopts.
        notify_leg_filled() therefore advances the legging state machine only
        on real fills. PAPER mirrors live friction: condor credit now applies
        PAPER_FILL_SLIPPAGE_PCT (it previously ignored the knob and filled at
        exact mid). price_effect kwarg dropped (ignored by SDK; sign carries
        the credit).
PHANTOM P&L RECOVERY + denser reconcile schedule.
        (a) A phantom (DB open, broker flat — e.g. a manual close at the broker)
            now books its REAL fill: one order-history read per reconcile pass,
            match_closing_fills() finds the closing order(s), phantom_pnl()
            books credit-signed truth into the DB (which DAILY_LOSS_LIMIT
            reads). No matching order (expiry/assignment) -> flagged $0.00 as
            before. Applies to BOTH the startup reconcile (history covers back
            to each phantom's entry date) and intraday sweeps.
        (b) Intraday sweeps every BROKER_RECONCILE_INTERVAL_MIN (default 10,
            was hardcoded 30), PLUS wind-down sweeps at 15:45, 15:50, and a
            final 15:57 post-flatten truth pass (last guaranteed look before
            the loop goes dormant at 16:00).
        (c) Phantom alerts now carry the recovered P&L.
Condor legs now record |short-strike delta| as setup_score
        (a calibration "street-sign", read AFTER the BB-anchored selector
        picks the strike — it does NOT influence selection or sizing). NULL
        when the Greeks feed did not populate delta, so a stored value is
        always a genuine delta. Enables later condor threshold calibration;
        previously condor legs logged no score at all.
handle_hard_close() now fetches the options chain once and
        passes it to flatten_all(), so the 15:45 force-flatten has real marks
        (paper fill price / live context) instead of booking at entry premium
        and logging every leg at +$0.00. Reused across the 15:45->16:00 retries.
defect H rename only: NO_ENTRY_AFTER_ET -> ORB_NO_ENTRY_AFTER_ET
        (import + the orb_state.json "past_cutoff" flag). Same constant, same
        (11, 0) value, same behaviour — the name now states its ORB scope.
        SWEEP_REVERSAL — because the ORB engine's break+retest is self-validating
        and the classifier does not test for it. Two changes in run_entry_logic:
        (1) the hard UNKNOWN gate is bypassed when the engine is in a confirmed
            OPEN state (the label no longer vetoes a proven setup);
        (2) the ORB dispatch admits UNKNOWN and SWEEP_REVERSAL (ORB beats sweep;
            engine no longer defers OPEN under a sweep — see orb_engine v3.2).
        Nothing else loosens: sweep/butterfly/condor still self-gate on their own
        False to restore strict v2 gating. Every ORB fired under UNKNOWN is logged
condor leg ENTRY alert now names the instrument. The leg-
        filled Telegram alert was built with a raw _send() that omitted the
        symbol (every other entry alert routes through the structured methods
        that already include it), so condor entries read "[PAPER] Condor Leg 2
        …" with no way to tell which box fired. Added {INSTRUMENT} after the
        mode, matching the "[MODE] SYMBOL | …" form of the other alerts. DB
        logging already recorded the symbol; this was display-only.
repo-wide v3.0 bump: Yahoo-Finance purge & data stream
        mapping optimization (all market data now flows from the single
        shared TastyTrade candle feed — see data/candle_feed.py). No logic
        change in this file.
INTRADAY broker reconcile (LIVE + enabled): every 30 min
        across RTH with the last sweep at 15:30, a leg-role-aware check catches
        positions the broker closed mid-session — especially a SHORT leg
        auto-closed while the long remains (loud alarm, close the broken record,
        adopt the surviving long so the 15:45 flatten handles it cleanly). Only
        inspects rows we already manage; fail-safe on a bad/empty read.
LIVE broker reconciliation wired into recovery: the broker
        is the source of truth for existence. _reconcile_with_broker() queries
        open positions, KEEPs DB-planned rows confirmed there, ADOPTs+journals
        broker positions with no DB plan (managed by the ADOPTED exit path),
        and closes PHANTOM DB rows the broker no longer shows. FAIL-SAFE: a
        failed or empty broker read never closes anything — falls back to
        DB-only recovery. Paper is unchanged (no broker query).
durable 15:45 flatten + expiry-aware recovery. handle_hard_
        close now routes through pos_mgr.flatten_all() so EVERY open record
        (both condor legs) is truly closed in the DB + P&L booked (the old path
        called place_exit_order directly and never wrote status='closed'),
        retries every tick to 16:00, and pages once on failure. Startup recovery
        keys on EXPIRY, not entry date (the bot trades weeklies): sweep only
        genuinely expired orphans, resume every still-live row, and flag a
        CARRIED-overnight position. Restart alerts self-identify (box symbol +
        fresh-boot vs service-restart from /proc/uptime).
directional-only instruments (single names): skip iron
        condor and butterfly in the dispatch; ORB + sweep only.
block new entries when the daily loss halt is active
        (day P&L <= -DAILY_LOSS_LIMIT_USD); open positions still exit.
(2a) ORB-window sweep override: when an ORB signal fires but
        a sweep reversal has higher conviction, take the sweep. (2b) pass the
        the broken-wing roll check when both condor verticals are open.
condor legs are now TRACKED positions: each vertical is
        sized at half the grade budget, written to the trade log, registered
        with the position manager (the only two-position strategy), and
        managed/exited per-side. Replaces the phantom notify-only path.
        halting: main_loop consumes RiskManager.consume_reassess_request() and
        reclassifies with trigger="loss_limit".
ORB range is now three-state (ESTABLISHED/IN_PROGRESS/
        EXPIRED) and always carries the last valid range. Startup fetch runs
        unconditionally (populates last-valid EXPIRED range pre-open); the
        open-poll runs from 9:30 ET and latches only when today's range is
        ESTABLISHED. Flag renamed orb_range_fetched_today -> _established_.
remove duplicate _execute_condor_leg (dead 2-arg def shadowed by
        a broken 3-arg def that referenced a non-existent CondorLeg class and
        mark_leg_filled method); single canonical impl on the real OptionsSignal
        API with live TastyTrade placement ported in. ORB range fetch is now
        success-keyed (retries until today's 9:30-9:35 candle is really written)
        and the startup fetch is gated to >= 9:35 ET so it never writes a
        stale prior-day range; instrument read from OT_INSTRUMENT (no systemd
        unit-file parsing).

# ── L2.5 (2026-07-21): wire the Layer-1 confluence scorer + Layer-2 conviction
# trades. WHY: the v1.3 classifier flickers to UNKNOWN for a single tick at high
# ADX (fleet-wide: UNKNOWN fired at avg ADX ~29, i.e. mid-trend, up to 41 on
# AAPL) — each flicker a hard no-trade gate slamming shut during exactly the
# evidence drops (theta_hold hysteresis) and NEVER emits UNKNOWN — indecision is
# a low conviction number on a best-fit label, not a seventh label. Gates run
# WIDE OPEN this week (conviction logged, not gated — L3 tunes the bars later);
# The variable was read by NOTHING. v3 used it to choose between the L2.5 stack
# and the v1.3 classifier; v4 removed both, and the log line below already
# states the answer unconditionally. What survived the port was an assert with
# no consumer — a gate that could only ever REFUSE TO START, never change
# behaviour.
#
# from the SMC fork. On v4 that value matched neither "l2" nor "v13", so the
# assert fired at import and systemd crash-looped it — restart counter at 4,
# `activating (auto-restart)`, on a box that had nothing wrong with its code.
# The guard was doing exactly what it was written to do, for a decision that no
# longer exists.
#
# ⚠️ THE GENERAL RULE, worth more than this instance: A GUARD OUTLIVES THE
# THING IT GUARDED. When a feature is removed, its validation is not neutral
# leftovers — it is a live veto over a value nothing consumes, and stale
# environment on a repointed box is exactly how it gets triggered. Deleting the
# consumer without deleting the assert is how a clean box refuses to boot.
# previous fork, and v4 neither reads it nor cares.
# ── v4.0 — THE LAYER-2 CONVICTION STACK IS GONE ─────────────────────────────
# try/except that set _L2_OK. At the v4 split those modules were dropped and the
# except branch became permanent: _L2_OK was ALWAYS False, so _l1_scorer and
# _l2_integ were ALWAYS None and every block gated on them was dead code that
# still had to be read and reasoned about by anyone touching this file.
#
# WHY THEY WENT. Measured 2026-08-19, tests/direction_skill.py, 715 closed
# directional trades across 16 sessions with ORB and neutral structures
# excluded: the label picked the correct SIDE on 44.9%, 95% CI [41.3%, 48.6%] -
# ENTIRELY BELOW A COIN FLIP. Calls 48.7%; puts 34.2%. ContinuationStrategy,
# which depended on it most, lost $5,872 across 660 trades.

# agreement is only confident once winning has already persisted.
#
# ⚠️ DO NOT REINTRODUCE A CONVICTION GATE. `MarketState.conviction` still exists

    ⚠️ THE LEDGER HAS BEEN BUILT, TESTED AND COLLECTING NOTHING SINCE 08-13.
    Every session it stays unwired is level history that CANNOT be recovered
    later — the tape survives, but the running touch/hold/breach record does
    not, and rebuilding it after the fact means re-deriving levels that the
    mapper found live.

    It implements the operator's retreat rule verbatim: a WICK reaching the
    level is a touch, a CLOSE beyond is a breach, a CLOSE back on the origin
    side is a hold, and a bar that never reaches does nothing.

    ⚠️ CLOSED BARS ONLY, and exactly once each. `df_1m`'s last row is the
    FORMING bar on most ticks — feeding it would count a wick that has not
    finished printing and a close that is not a close, and would count the same
    bar dozens of times as it forms. `_LEDGER_LAST_BAR` is the guard.

    ⚠️ SEEDS COME FROM THE MAPPER, never re-derived here. LIQ.6 changed what a
    named pool IS (sections, closed-only, a 3-deep ladder), so the ledger takes
    whatever the mapper currently names — including the `(R1)`/`(R2)`/`(R3)`
    rung suffixes — rather than holding a second opinion about levels.

    # where in the tick you stand — an input present for one consumer and
    # absent for another. No derived port may be built that way.
    # ⚠️ CONTRIBUTORS, NEVER GATES — operator's ruling. `run_all` and every
    # engine's `run()` are wrapped so nothing here can raise into the tick
    # loop, and the whole block is belt-and-braces wrapped again. A box with
    # no derived store trades EXACTLY as it does today.

    # "measured as absent" from "this port does not exist in this build".

    # INFORMS and gates nothing, like every other derived port.
    # r78 — fork tilt, PARALLEL like ADX/ATR/gap: recorded and shown, feeding
    # no axis and gating nothing. The condor still anchors on the fork's

    two legs of a condor share an underlying and a session, and picking the

    bars, while asserting "the bars do not go anywhere." They go off the LEFT
    EDGE of a rolling window: the 09:30-09:35 bars leave a 60-bar 1m frame at
    ~10:35 ET — 25 minutes BEFORE TCS_START_ET (11:00) — so the bound was

    2026-08-17: `[tcs] no opening-range` on up to 290 of 290 evaluated ticks;

    is a rolling window and neither is guaranteed to reach 09:30."

    5-minute window" was false for this repo's constants:
    ORB_WINDOW_MINUTES=5 and 5m bars align to :30, so TODAY'S 09:30 bar IS
    the opening range, exactly — and the 5m frame holds it all session on
    every box (RTH-only tape spans the day with margin; SPX's 24h tape
    reaches back ~8.3h, keeping 09:30 in-frame past the close). The 1m
    window remains as the early-session supplement (before today's first 5m
    bar prints) and as the general path for any ORB_WINDOW_MINUTES not
    divisible by 5. Both paths filter to TODAY — an RTH-only 5m frame
    carries ~1.3 sessions, so yesterday's 09:30 bar is usually present too
    and must never become today's bound.

    # direction (BULLISH/BEARISH, not NEUTRAL) AND primary_adx clears
    # CONT_BREAKOUT_MIN_ADX. Widening this tuple alone would NOT open the trade —

    # on a directionless tape.

    # runaway ORB flag let continuation fire on ANY tape — at Priority 2, ahead
    # of Butterfly (P3, RANGING/COMPRESSION) and Condor (P4, RANGING), which sit
    # behind `if signal is None` and were never even evaluated. That is the
    # squeeze: 13 sessions show RANGING → Continuation 94 vs IronCondor 27, and
    # COMPRESSION → Continuation 39 vs Butterfly 6.
    # The block goes HERE rather than in the strategy because a strategy-level
    # veto still consumes the dispatch slot on its way to returning None — CNT.3
    # blocked the COMPRESSION handoff inside continuation_strategy and the
    # squeeze continued regardless.

    # ── v4.0: SUPERSEDED STRATEGY REMOVED ───────────────────────────────
    # Continuation, SweepReversal and Butterfly dispatched here. All three
    # UNKNOWN - so they were DEAD CODE that still had to be read and
    # reasoned about by anyone auditing this path.
    # Their replacements are written and specced in docs/TRADES.md:
    #   ContinuationStrategy  -> RunawayContinuation (observes a move in
    #                            evidence rather than forecasting one)
    #   SweepReversalStrategy -> SweepCreditSpread (a long reversal needs
    #                            price to TRAVEL; 82% of directionally-
    #                            correct entries never reached +25% MFE)
    #   ButterflyStrategy     -> GEXPinButterfly (centres on the PIN, not
    #                            spot - indistinguishable while GEX was
    #                            gamma-squared, because the pin WAS spot)
    # ⚠️ NOT YET WIRED. The new strategies exist and import; dispatch is a
    # separate deliberate step, and Fable audits the plumbing first.
    # Priority 2.5 (was 2): Sweep Reversal.
    # After a runaway, sweep is the FALLBACK (continuation had no pullback setup)
    # and is gated to NAMED levels only — a runaway that then sweeps a real pool
    # and rejects is a legitimate reversal; a runaway that pokes an equal-H/L is
    # not. Non-runaway sweeps are unchanged (fire as before on the SWEEP label).
    # committed label to be SWEEP_REVERSAL; that label wins 0.4% of live ticks
    # and is exactly zero on 96%, so the trade was effectively off, and F7's
    # commit threshold narrowed it further. It now gates on the L1 _sweep SETUP
    # SCORE, whose three HARD VETOES are precisely the operator's stated
    # condition — a NAMED level (veto_loc), REJECTED back through (veto_reclaim),
    # not accepted beyond (veto_accept). A non-zero score already means all
    # three passed.
    # THE PLTR PROTECTION TRAVELS WITH THE SCORE: `trend_opp` is a
    # soft-necessary inside _sweep, so a reversal into a strong ACCELERATING
    # opposing trend still scores 0 and still cannot fire. That guard lived in
    # the scorer, never in this gate — which is why gating on the score keeps it
    # and gating on anything else would have lost it.
    _sweep_setup = 0.0
    # PHASE B (r58): the L1 read is DELETED. `ctx["l1"]` is set NOWHERE in
    # v4 — the scorer was never ported — so _sweep_setup has been a silent
    # 0.0 since the split and this block was a guard over a value nothing
    # computes (the r55/r57 lesson at score scale). The PLTR protection the
    # comment above describes lives in the v3 scorer, not here; if it is
    # wanted in v4 it must be REBUILT from structure, not resurrected by
    # name. _sweep_setup stays 0.0 — honest about what is measured: nothing.
    # Priority 3: Butterfly (Ranging/Compression — requires GEX PINNING)
    # Fed days allowed — bot reaction time is faster and more systematic
    # than manual trading on a volatile FOMC day. Fed day boosts ORB
    # conviction instead of blocking entries.
