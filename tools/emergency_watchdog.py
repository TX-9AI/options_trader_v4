tools/emergency_watchdog.py  v1.1-otv4 — THE OUT-OF-PROCESS EMERGENCY WATCHDOG.

otv4 v1.1  2026-10-05  r474 / WDOG.1 — MIRRORED ON MAINLINE from OTV4TEST r168 + r242 (7130c51), on
      the operator's ruling: "Can we adopt the watchdog". ONE CODE CHANGE, named: flatten_pass
      calls flatten_all(reason=, chain=) WITHOUT spot= — mainline's PositionManager.flatten_all
      has no spot parameter, so the fork's call raised TypeError on every pass and would have
      closed nothing (pinned by check_emergency_watchdog W15/W15b). Mainline's own flatten is
      15:40-15:45, so a healthy bot is flat before 15:50 and this acts only on a hung one.

v1.1  2026-10-04  OTV4TEST r242 (LIVE.1 B0, FORK-ONLY) — cancel_working() called account.get_live_orders /
      delete_order bare; on tastytrade 13.x those are coroutines, so on a LIVE box the 15:50 watchdog
      could cancel nothing. Both now go through tasty_client.sdk_result. Found by check_sdk_async A4
      (mirrored from otv4 r463) - mainline has no watchdog, so this half is this tree's alone.

v1.0  2026-09-27  OTV4TEST r168 (EXP.1 item 3). Operator, 2026-09-27: *"Not a
      bad idea to have one for 'emergencies'"*; asked what it should do when the
      bot is dead or stuck with a position open: **"Page, then close at 15:50"**;
      whether a dead bot with NO position is an emergency: **"No, positions
      only"**; and on the first build, which paged early and again on recovery:
      *"I already have a bot blind notification. I don't think i need a
      duplicate of that"* -> *"Keep it, as long as it's not a duplicate line of
      effort or I'll be getting multiple notifications for a single event"*.

WHAT IT COVERS THAT NOTHING ELSE DID. systemd restarts a CRASHED bot in 30s;
the bot pages its own blindness and its own shutdown. The uncovered case is
the bot ALIVE BUT STUCK (a hung call, a wedged loop) or DOWN AND NOT COMING
BACK while a position is open: it cannot page about itself, and its own
end-of-day close never runs. This runs in its own process from its own timer.

THE RULE, EVERY MINUTE ON A TRADING DAY 09:30-16:05 ET:
  healthy  = the bot's service is `active` AND its heartbeat (data/BOT_HEARTBEAT,
             touched at the top of every main-loop pass) is <= 180s old — or the
             process started < 300s ago (a boot is not a hang).
  Before 15:50 it WATCHES AND SAYS NOTHING (the ruling: no duplicate of the
  bot's own alerts). From 15:50 to 16:00, unhealthy on two consecutive
  minutes with a position open: THE EMERGENCY CLOSE, once a day —
    1. STOP the bot HARD (SIGKILL, then `systemctl stop` inside the 30s restart
       delay so systemd does not bring it back). Hard, because the bot's
       SIGTERM handler exists only to send a STOPPED page — a second message
       for this event. A bot that will not die is never closed beside: nothing
       is sent to the broker and the one page says close by hand.
    2. live only: cancel the instrument's working broker orders.
    3. run the bot's OWN end-of-day close (position_manager.flatten_all — the
       same ladder, the same $0.00 rule, the same 15:55 cross, the same booking)
       every 15s until flat or 16:00.
    4. ONE page: why, each position closed with its P&L, anything still open.
  The bot is NOT restarted (its startup page would be a second message); it
  starts at the next boot, and the page says so.

🔑 ONE EVENT, ONE MESSAGE — HOW. The bot's code running in THIS process
(flatten_all -> exit alerts) would page every close. load_env() therefore takes
TELEGRAM_TOKEN / TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID OUT of this process's environment and keeps
them for the watchdog's own sender alone; config reads them at call time, so
every AlertManager built here is disabled.

⚠️ WHY A HEARTBEAT FILE AND NOT bot.log's AGE. Measured 09-14..09-25: bot.log
went silent for 703-1208s at 15:39-15:41 ET on 09-18, 09-21 and 09-23 — the
very window this acts in. A log-age rule would have called a quiet bot stuck.
Ticks average 15.1s (900 twenty-tick windows; the slowest averaged 21.9s), so
180s is twelve ticks of margin.
⚠️ THE BOT'S ENVIRONMENT IS READ AT RUN TIME (`systemctl show <svc> -p
Environment`), never copied at install: configure.sh edits the unit, and a
stale copy would close a LIVE book as paper. Nothing here prints a value.
⚠️ HALF DAYS ARE NOT MODELLED, as everywhere in this tree (market_calendar).
⚠️ THE WHOLE BOX DOWN IS NOT COVERED: nothing on the box can page then.
⚠️ A DELIBERATE STOP with a position still open at 15:50 is closed like a hang.
⚠️ ALWAYS EXITS 0: a red here is a page, not a failed unit.

Run:  venv/bin/python tools/emergency_watchdog.py            (the timer's call)
