# push.sh  v4.1
v4.1  2026-08-25  r65 EXORCISM: every mention of the retired classification
      system removed - identifiers, comments, docstrings, schema. The word
      does not appear in this tree. Full accounting: REMOVAL_LOG (delivery).

# Pushes the control checkout to GitHub.
#
# v4.0  2026-08-19  Ported from options_trader_v3 at the OTV4 split.
#
# INHERITED DOCTRINE
# MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
# Dated release framing and trivia are stripped; what remains is the
# reasoning behind the thresholds, the design guarantees, and the
# defects that recur when forgotten. WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires
# this block be read before the file is edited.
#
#!/bin/bash
# push.sh — Vertigo Capital Git Push / Deploy Tool
# initial release
# add rebase pull before push, fix success check, exclude WAL files
# auto-detect and repair doubled/malformed remote URLs
# handle diverged/unrelated history cleanly (force-push prompt)
# normalize the executable bit on all tracked .sh files
# set git author to the repo owner (TX-9AI)
# add DOWNLOAD direction so fleet can wake a box and deploy:
#         `push.sh --deploy` (alias --pull) fetches origin and hard-resets THIS
#         bot to the remote branch, repairs .sh +x, restarts the service, and
#         verifies it. `--no-restart` skips the restart. Default (no flag) is the
#         original upload: commit local changes and push to GitHub.
#         Unattended-safe: per-bot config is in the systemd env; runtime state
#         (trades.db, bot.log, orb_state.json, orb_range.json) is untracked and
#         is NOT touched by `git reset --hard`.
# derive REPO from the remote URL instead of hardcoding
#         options_trader_v2. The v3.0 header bump left the detection pinned to
#         v2, so a box repointed to v3 would get dragged back to v2 on the next
#         deploy/push. REPO is now parsed from origin (token- and .git-safe),
#         so v2/v3/future all resolve correctly. SERVICE still keyed by family.
# repo-wide v3.0 bump: Yahoo-Finance purge & data stream
#         mapping optimization (single shared TastyTrade candle feed). No
#         logic change in this file.
# Usage:
#   bash push.sh                        — commit local changes & push to GitHub
#   bash push.sh "your commit message"  — push with a custom message
#   bash push.sh --deploy               — fetch + reset --hard + restart (pull side)
#   bash push.sh --deploy --no-restart  — deploy without restarting the service
# the v1.8 refusal told you to `pip install pyflakes`, which
#         provisions one tool by hand and leaves the next one to be discovered
#         the same way. It now points at install_tooling.sh, which installs the
#         repo's own requirements into whatever python is active — venv if the
#         checkout is a full setup_ec2.sh install, system python if it is a bare
#         clone. Every bot here runs independently of any controller, so the repo
#         has to be able to provision itself wherever it lands.
# UNDEFINED-NAME GATE before commit. The box-side deploy
#         check is `python -c "import ast"`, which proves a file COMPILES; an
#         undefined name compiles fine and raises at RUNTIME, so the deploy path
#         could not see the class that cost two sessions in two days —
#         continuation `mid` (07-29, whole ORB window, all 15 boxes) and
#         it clean). pyflakes now runs over the tracked *.py set and REFUSES the
#         commit on any "undefined name". Missing pyflakes is a REFUSAL, never a
# TARGET RESOLUTION: prefer the caller's directory over the
#         $HOME scan, and ANNOUNCE the resolved target + remote before acting.
#         The old block ignored $PWD entirely and took the first $HOME entry
#         containing main.py+config.py — invisible on a bot box (one bot per
#         home), wrong on the control server. Run from ~/options-trader-v3 with
#         a futures_trader_v1 checkout present, it cd'd into FUTURES and refused
#         with a message naming the wrong project's remote; refusing was luck,
#         since a successful push would have written options_trader files into
#         the futures repo. Order is now: exported $BOT_DIR -> $PWD if it looks
#         like a bot checkout -> $HOME scan (with a loud warning when the
#         fallback is what resolved it). Prerequisite for the nested-module
#         layout in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, where the scan becomes ambiguous by
#         construction rather than by accident.

# ── Detect which bot and repo ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
# v1.7 — PREFER THE CALLER'S DIRECTORY. This block used to go straight to the
# $HOME scan below, ignoring where it was invoked from. On a bot box that is
# invisible (one bot per $HOME); on the CONTROL server it picks whichever
# project sorts first. On 2026-07-29, run from ~/options-trader-v3 with a
# futures_trader_v1 checkout also present, it cd'd into FUTURES and refused
# with "Could not detect repo from git remote" — naming the wrong project's
# remote. Refusing was lucky: a successful push would have written
# options_trader files into the futures repo.
