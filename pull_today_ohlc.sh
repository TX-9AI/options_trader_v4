# Pulls the current session's OHLC from a box.

# v4.0  2026-08-19  Ported from options_trader_v3 at the OTV4 split.

# INHERITED DOCTRINE
# MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
# Dated release framing and trivia are stripped; what remains is the

# options_trader_v3/pull_today_ohlc.sh — one-shot EOD retrieval of TODAY's FULL 1-min session on THIS box.
# GUARD BACK ON BY DEFAULT. The v1.4 disable was a response
#        to a misdiagnosis: the failing backfill was `candle_feed --once` hanging
#        on ITS OWN RTH gate (v3.10), not this one. With that fixed, v1.3's
#        condition is correct and protects a real case — a pull fired at a
#        TRADING box mid-session stops its feed for ~200s while the bot reads a
#        frozen store. Reports and backfills are unaffected: they run against
#        boxes with no bot, or after the close. OT_PULL_RTH_GUARD=0 still
#        disables it.
# RTH GUARD OFF BY DEFAULT (operator directive). Gated on
#        OT_PULL_RTH_GUARD; set it to 1 to restore v1.3 behaviour. The refusal
#        path is unchanged and still there — only its default flipped, so this
#        is one env var to reverse rather than a deletion to re-derive.
#        NOTE FOR THE LATER DISCUSSION: the 2026-08-04 16:28 backfill that
#        prompted this returned "0 full, 0 short, 14 still missing" with
#        "0 bot box(es) currently running" and POSTCLOSE=1 — a state where
#        NEITHER v1.1's guard NOR v1.3's could fire. Whatever blocked that run
#        was downstream of the guard entirely; the box-side
#        pull_today_ohlc.log holds the actual reason.
# THE RTH GUARD WAS BLOCKING THE BACKFILL IT WAS NEVER MEANT
#        TO BLOCK. v1.1's test was "candle-feed live AND before 16:00 ET" — a
#        pure clock check. eod_backfill wakes SAT-OUT boxes mid-session to fetch
#        their candles; those boxes have a cold store and no trading bot, so the
#        guard refused the one rebuild that would have produced anything and the
#        script wrote a HEADER-ONLY csv instead. Measured 2026-08-04: fourteen
#        38-byte files against fifteen 15-16 KB ones from the boxes that were
#        already running. DXFeed history is SAME-EVENING ONLY, so every session
#        lost this way is lost permanently at midnight.
#        The guard now also requires `optionsbot` to be ACTIVE — that is the
#        consumer a feed stop would starve, and it is what the guard was for.
#        Post-close behaviour is unchanged; Mandate 2 is unchanged (the feed is
#        still stopped before the --once pass and restarted after).
# Hoist TT_* cred fetch to the top of __work so BOTH the v3 --once refill and a
#        v2 self-subscribing logger run with creds in-process (v3 logger ignores them). This lets the
#        EOD timer's oneshot service call `__work` directly and keep NO secrets in the unit file.
# Full-session correctness fix. The v3 candle-feed store is pruned to
#        max(need,60)*PRUNE_FACTOR = 240 one-minute bars, but an RTH session is ~390 (09:30-16:00),
#        so a plain store read after ~noon silently drops the morning (opening range / ORB window).
#        On v3 this now ALWAYS rebuilds the full session first via ONE synchronous producer pass
#        (data.candle_feed --once backfills 1m from 09:30 and flushes), stopping candle-feed first
#        so there is never a second live producer (Mandate 2), then reads+exports, then restores the
#        feed. Guard: if it is still RTH (before 16:00 ET) AND the feed is live, it will NOT stop the
#        feed (would starve the trading bot) — it reads the store and flags the result as partial.
#        Symbol is passed explicitly (--symbols) so it never depends on OT_INSTRUMENT being in env.
# initial: background-detached retrieval (fleet.py run has a ~22s SSH ceiling;
#        a v2 drain / --once warm can exceed it), --check readout, v2/v3 aware.
# Usage (from the control server):
#   1) python fleet.py run 'bash ~/options-trader/pull_today_ohlc.sh'            # launch on all
#   2) (wait ~60s) python fleet.py run 'bash ~/options-trader/pull_today_ohlc.sh --check'
#   3) python fleet.py pull ohlc --day <today-ET>                                # SCP to control

        # woken mid-session purely to backfill was refused the rebuild, read its
        # COLD store, and wrote a HEADER-ONLY csv. Measured 2026-08-04: fourteen
        # 38-byte files at 11:11/11:18/11:23 ET while the fifteen trading boxes
        # wrote 15-16 KB. Two sessions of sat-out tape lost that way, and DXFeed
        # history is same-evening only, so each one is permanent at midnight.
        # WHAT THE GUARD IS ACTUALLY PROTECTING is a TRADING BOT on THIS box —
        # stopping candle-feed under a live optionsbot starves its analysis. A
        # box with optionsbot INACTIVE has no such consumer: stopping its feed
        # for one synchronous producer pass starves nobody, and that is exactly
        # the population backfill wakes.
        # MANDATE 2 IS UNAFFECTED. The feed is still stopped before the --once
        # pass and restarted after, so there is never a second live producer on
        # this box either way.

        # it cannot fire. `candle_feed` v3.10 was. Leaving this off would have
        # removed a protection that IS correct to pay for a bug elsewhere.
        # `OT_PULL_RTH_GUARD=0` remains the escape hatch, and should sit unused —
        # a knob you HAVE to set is a design smell.
        # WHAT IS BEING GIVEN UP, stated so the re-enable decision is informed:
        # with the guard off, a pull fired at a TRADING box during RTH will stop
        # its candle-feed for the ~200s producer pass. Its bot keeps running but
        # reads a frozen store for that window — every engine that consumes 1m/5m
        # frames sees stale bars, and market_data v3.3's bar-recency guard will
        # start recording BLINDNESS. Mandate 2 still holds (feed stopped before
        # the pass, restarted after), so this is a starvation risk, never a
        # double-producer one.
        # IT IS NOT A RISK AT ALL ON A BOX WITH NO BOT, which is the population
        # eod_backfill wakes — hence v1.3's narrower condition, which this knob
        # now sits on top of rather than replacing.
