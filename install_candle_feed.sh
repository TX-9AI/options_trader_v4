#!/usr/bin/env bash
# install_candle_feed.sh — options_trader v3
# install the v3 candle-feed.service on a box that was set
#        up pre-v3 (repointed to v3 code, but the new shared feed service was
#        never created — `systemctl is-enabled candle-feed` => not-found).
# WHY: v3 routes ALL market data through one DXFeed subscription per box
# (data/candle_feed.py) writing a shared SQLite store every consumer reads.
# setup_ec2.sh v3.2 generates candle-feed.service; a plain repoint syncs code
# and restarts optionsbot but does NOT create that unit, so every bot finds the
# feed store missing, falls back to a REST market-data call (403), can't price,
# and self-exits into a systemd restart loop.
# This installer reuses the TT_* creds ALREADY present in the running optionsbot
# unit (same inline Environment= form setup_ec2.sh writes), so no secrets are
# re-entered or moved between machines. It is idempotent: safe to re-run.
# Run per box (from the control server):
#   python fleet.py run 'bash ~/options-trader/install_candle_feed.sh'
