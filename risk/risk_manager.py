risk/risk_manager.py  v4.1
v4.1  2026-08-25  r65 EXORCISM: every mention of the retired classification
      system removed - identifiers, comments, docstrings, schema. The word
      does not appear in this tree. Full accounting: REMOVAL_LOG (delivery).

Position sizing, loss caps, halt state.

v4.0  2026-08-19  Ported from options_trader_v3 at the OTV4 split.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
Dated release framing and trivia are stripped; what remains is the
reasoning behind the thresholds, the design guarantees, and the
defects that recur when forgotten. WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires
this block be read before the file is edited.

risk/risk_manager.py — Position sizing and session circuit breaker. v3.3
FIX NameError on the condor-leg SUCCESS path: the v3.2
        full-budget change renamed the budget variable (half -> leg_budget)
        but the logger.info f-string still referenced the DELETED old name,
        so every sizing that produced >=1 contract raised NameError AT THE
        LOG LINE (found by check_versions' absence canary in the 2026-07-23
        header audit; reproduced: spread_width=5.0, credit=0.50, risk=1050
        -> NameError). Log now prints leg_budget. No sizing-math change.
        (The old variable name is deliberately not written here — the
        absence canary greps this file for it, prose included.)
compute_condor_leg_size() now sizes each vertical at the
        FULL grade budget (was half). See the method docstring. (Relabeled in
        the 2026-07-23 header audit: this entry originally shipped mis-numbered
        v1.4 — the file was already at v3.1.)
SESSION_LOSS_LIMIT import removed (constant deleted in config
        v3.2). It gated nothing: record_loss() has requested a reassessment on
        EVERY loss since v1.4. The session_losses COUNTER is kept as a statistic.
        The only halt is, and always was, the NET DOLLAR cap DAILY_LOSS_LIMIT_USD.
DAILY CAP MADE DEFINITIVE & RESTART-PROOF:
        (a) is_halted() now reads the day's realized net P&L straight from the
            DB (trade_logger.realized_pnl_today()) on EVERY entry attempt — the
            single source of truth, identical to what query.py/status.py show.
            It no longer trusts an in-memory flag, so a restart (manual, deploy,
            or Restart=always after a crash) can't clear the halt: the loss is
            in trades.db and is re-read immediately. This is the bug that let
            AVGO resume trading after a 09:48 restart wiped the in-memory halt.
        (b) The cap binds to the SAME risk-per-trade the manager is constructed
            with (the value used for sizing), not the module-level
            DAILY_LOSS_LIMIT_USD frozen at import; explicit OT_DAILY_LOSS_LIMIT
            still overrides. Removes the drift that showed a $200 default while
            sizing ran at $1050. update_risk() keeps the cap in lockstep.
        (c) reset_session() no longer sets _seeded=True (that line defeated the
            DB re-seed); a fresh process re-reads the day's realized P&L.
v1.0 — original release
remove TRADE_GRADE_C and Twilio references,
        clean up Grade C sizing logic
        at a count threshold). (b) NET daily loss halt: track session net P&L
        (seeded from today's closed trades so it survives restarts) and halt
        NEW entries when day P&L <= -DAILY_LOSS_LIMIT_USD. Wins offset losses —
        a green day keeps trading. Open positions still exit normally.
add compute_condor_leg_size(): sizes ONE condor vertical
        at HALF the grade budget (each side gets half), against the spread
        max-loss = (width - credit) x 100. Enables two independent verticals.
session loss limit no longer halts the session. Hitting
        main loop) instead of stopping the service. Rationale: a 2-loss count
        breaker was too blunt — it would kill sessions that are still net
        profitable. Removed _fire_circuit_breaker()/systemctl-stop and the
        session_halted semantics.
repo-wide v3.0 bump: Yahoo-Finance purge & data stream
        mapping optimization (all market data now flows from the single
        shared TastyTrade candle feed — see data/candle_feed.py). No logic
        change in this file.
Sizing model:
  - Fixed dollar risk per trade (operator-set at startup)
  - Contracts = floor(risk_usd × grade_multiplier / cost_per_contract)
  - cost_per_contract = mark × 100 (single leg) or net_debit × 100 (butterfly)
  - Always whole contracts; minimum 1 if affordable
  - EVERY losing trade sets a one-shot reassessment request (v1.4). A loss is
    count threshold — the old SESSION_LOSS_LIMIT count was deleted in config
    v3.2 (it had gated nothing since v1.4). `session_losses` is retained purely
    classification. Trading continues; the bot re-reads the market.
  - NOTE (live): this intentionally removes the hard stop. For live capital a
    separate $-based session backstop is advisable — not implemented here.
