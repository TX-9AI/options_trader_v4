risk/setup_scorer.py  v4.1

v4.1  2026-08-21  PHASE B (r58): reads vix_band (renamed from vix_regime).
Journaling and gate plumbing. FACTOR SET REMOVED - see VISION.

v4.0  2026-08-19  Ported from options_trader_v3 at the OTV4 split.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
Dated release framing and trivia are stripped; what remains is the
reasoning behind the thresholds, the design guarantees, and the
defects that recur when forgotten. WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires
this block be read before the file is edited.

risk/setup_scorer.py — Scores and grades options trade signals A/B.
CONTINUATION GETS AN EXPLICIT PROFILE. It had none, so it
        fell through to `"default"` — a silent default nobody chose for the
        strategy carrying 77%% of fleet volume. In that profile
        `regime_conviction` weighs 0.30 and `signal_quality` 0.25, and
        continuation_strategy.py sets `signal.conviction = regime.conviction`.
        THE SAME NUMBER, WEIGHTED TWICE = 55%% of the grade. Measured over 619
        joined trades (scorer_backtest, 18 sessions): both dimensions report
        identical medians AND identical spreads (0.913 / 0.636), because they
        are one column printed twice. `vwap_alignment` and `liquidity_clear`
        measured CONSTANT at 1.000 across all 619 — another 35%%. So ~90%% of
        the grade was a duplicate or a constant, and the grade INVERTED:
        A 399 trades -$8,244 (-$21/trade at 1.5x size) vs B 220 trades
        +$1,893 (+$9). High conviction means the trend is already obvious,
        which means LATE — v1.4 stripped exactly this from the ORB, calling it
        "regime conviction in costume", and left it on continuation.
        THE TOTAL IS ARITHMETICALLY UNCHANGED: 0.55*conv + 0.15*vwap +
        0.20*liq + 0.10*macro is what the default profile already computed via
        0.30+0.25 on one number. grade_b stays 0.55, so THE FIRE/NO-FIRE
        POPULATION IS PROVABLY IDENTICAL — this deploy cannot change which
        setups trade. The ONLY behavioural change is grade_a, set above the
        reachable maximum (1.00) so no continuation setup earns the 1.5x size
        upgrade on a grade measured to be anti-predictive. The bar comes back
        DOWN onto whatever `tests/factor_sweep.py` proves separates; it is not
        a permanent verdict, it is a refusal to pay 1.5x for a coin flip.
        `signal_quality` is still journalled (breakdown is built before the
        weighted sum) — it is telemetry now, not a grade input.
F: MIN_RRR FLOOR. Second genesis constant (`MIN_RRR = 1.3
        # UNWIRED`), read by nothing since the beginning. MEASURED premise: a
        setup with rrr = 1.00 scores 0.84 and grades **A** — a 1:1 risk-reward
        trade is currently a top-grade fire, because the 5-dimension scorer has
        no RRR input at all. Hard floor on the scored path; **ORB is
        COUNTER-ONLY, never blocked** — its RRR is structural (stop = range
        boundary, target = measured move), so a narrow range mechanically
        produces a low ratio without the setup being worse, and gating the only
        strategy currently earning on a ratio it does not control is not a trade
        we make on zero evidence. Measure first. rrr of None (no planned stop or
        target) is INERT, not a violation: absence of evidence must not collapse
        into "worst possible trade". Ships DEFAULT OFF (`OT_MIN_RRR_ACTIVE`),
        floor `OT_MIN_RRR` default 1.3 — the genesis value, explicitly a PRIOR
        awaiting the Aug 1 fit, not a fitted number.
E: VWAP HARD GATE. `vwap_alignment` scores 0.11 against a
        0.55 grade-B bar, so misalignment could never veto — a long BELOW vwap
        scored 0.73 and graded B (measured, not hypothesised). The gate now
        blocks, placed AFTER the score is final so the journal records what the
        blocked setup WOULD have graded; blocking earlier would save microseconds
        and destroy the evidence the retro ledger needs. Ships DEFAULT OFF
        (`OT_VWAP_FILTER_ACTIVE`) as a log-only counter until blocked trades are
        shown net-negative — evidence decides. ORB exempt by construction (it
        short-circuits to _grade_orb and never reaches here), matching defect V.
        Inert when `price_vs_vwap == "NONE"` (the 07-17 SPX zero-volume case:
        VWAP undefined is not VWAP misaligned) and on neutral direction.
        +`_journal_gate_block()` emitting N.2's `gate_block:<gate>` disposition —
        without it a gate vetoes invisibly and can never be calibrated from its
        own rejections.
ORB IS A GEOMETRY GATE, NOT A WEIGHTED SCORE. The ORB
        was being run through the same 5-dimension weighted sum as every
        other strategy (regime_conviction, orb_quality, vwap_alignment,
        liquidity_clear, macro_context). That was wrong for this trade by
        design: the ORB is regime-AGNOSTIC (it is deliberately not regime-
        gated at dispatch) yet regime_conviction was 20%% of its grade; VWAP
        and macro have no bearing on a mechanically-confirmed break+retest;
        and orb_quality was a confluence-COUNT proxy (0.2*n) that never
        measured the geometry its docstring claimed. Net effect: the A/B
        grade of an ORB was regime conviction in costume, and liquidity-in-
        path could VETO a confirmed setup by dragging the weighted total
        under the bar.
        NOW: the ORB short-circuits BEFORE the weighted machinery. A
        confirmed ORB ALWAYS trades. The ONLY grade input is whether an
        unswept liquidity pool sits between the breakout and the 100%% TP:
          - clear path  -> A (1.5x size)
          - pool in path -> B (1.0x size)
        Liquidity can downgrade A->B; it can NEVER veto. No regime, no VWAP,
        no macro, no confluence count, no brief nudge, no session modifier
        touch the ORB grade. _orb_quality is DELETED. The 5-dimension path is
        unchanged for SweepReversal / Butterfly / Condor / default.
SIGNAL JOURNAL (ROADMAP Phase 3.1 instrumentation, log-only):
        every scored signal — including below-B REJECTS — emits one `scored`
        event to analysis/signal_journal with the full breakdown, thresholds,
        regime conviction, quote context (bid/ask/spread/IV at signal time)
        and vol/macro snapshot. Zero behavior change: the journal call is
        wrapped so any failure degrades to a missing log line, never an
        exception; grading logic is untouched. This is the perishable data
        the Phase-3 conviction-bar buckets need — "a gate you can't
        counterfactual is a gate you can't calibrate."
BRIEF NUDGE: a signed post-sum adjustment (cap ±0.05) from
        the pre-market move-probability brief. This box reads its own line from
        ~/brief_flags.json ({symbol, strength 0..1, date}); the nudge is
        +strength·cap for ORB (catalyst helps a breakout), -strength·cap for
        butterfly/condor (catalyst fights a pin/range), and ZERO for sweep
        reversal (structure-driven, catalyst-agnostic). Applied to the final
        total AFTER the weighted sum and late-session modifier, BEFORE the
        grade compare — so the ±0.05 lands literally on the score as a
        tie-breaker; it can never rescue a bad setup or sink a good one.
        Absent/stale/mismatched flag file => strength 0 => no nudge. Knob:
        config.BRIEF_CONVICTION_WEIGHT (default 0.05).
v3.0 — original release — A/B/C grading
eliminated C grade entirely. There is no such thing
        as a C-grade setup by definition — anything below the B threshold
        is not a valid trade and returns None instead of a downsized
        position. This prevents marginal/low-conviction setups from ever
        firing in live trading regardless of available capital.
        Grade determines position size multiplier: A=1.5x, B=1.0x.
remove duplicate Fed-day boost. is_fed_day was being
        applied twice on ORB: once in the macro_context dimension (its
        designated home) and again inside _orb_quality, double-counting the
        effect and polluting a dimension that measures confluence/regime/
        liquidity. Fed-day now boosts ORB through macro_context only.
repo-wide v3.0 bump: Yahoo-Finance purge & data stream
        mapping optimization (all market data now flows from the single
        shared TastyTrade candle feed — see data/candle_feed.py). No logic
        change in this file.
v-namelevels (2026-07-28) — ORB grade line names the pools in path instead of
        counting them ("2 pool(s) in path: PDL@371.65, ..."), and the breakdown gains
        pools_in_path_detail. Observability only; grading unchanged.
