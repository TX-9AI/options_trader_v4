"""
strategy/orb_strategy.py  v4.0
Opening-range break and retest. Regime-agnostic by design.

v4.0  2026-08-19  Ported from options_trader_v3 at the OTV4 split.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
Dated release framing and trivia are stripped; what remains is the
reasoning behind the thresholds, the design guarantees, and the
defects that recur when forgotten. WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires
this block be read before the file is edited.

strategy/orb_strategy.py — ORB break-and-retest signal generation.
v3.0 — original release
populate orb_range_high/low on signal so exit_engine
        can apply strategy-aware ORB stop logic
update state check for orb_engine v1.1 rename:
        CONFIRMED_LONG/SHORT -> OPEN_LONG/SHORT
repo-wide v3.0 bump: Yahoo-Finance purge & data stream
        mapping optimization (all market data now flows from the single
        shared TastyTrade candle feed — see data/candle_feed.py). No logic
        change in this file.
Liquidity-aware ORB logic:
RULE 1 — Named level IS the break level (catalyst, not obstacle):
  If the ORB high/low sits within 0.15% of a named pool (PDH, PDL, session H/L),
  and the break direction is THROUGH that level, this is a high-quality setup.
  The sweep of that level IS the ORB catalyst. Add confluence, don't penalize.
RULE 2 — Named level in path between entry and 50% TP (hard reduce):
  A named pool sitting between entry and the trail-activation level is a known
  reversal zone. Require at least one extra confluence factor, OR block.
RULE 3 — Named level just beyond 100% TP (adjust target, don't block):
  If a named pool sits within 0.5 ORB-widths past the 100% TP, move the target
  to that pool price rather than projecting past it.
v-namelevels (2026-07-28) — the liquidity gate NAMES the levels it blocks on.
        Was: "Named pool in fakeout zone (entry->50%TP): 1 named level(s)." — a bare
        count, unauditable. On 2026-07-28 this gate held the AVGO ORB short for SIX
        consecutive ticks (13:42:15 -> 13:43:30, 90s) starting the same tick the
        retest confirmed; the trade finally filled at 372.11 — 1.4pt below the
        confirmation and 0.5pt off the absolute low — then reversed and stopped out
        (-$135.50). The block never said WHAT it blocked on. Now logs name@price for
        every pool in the fakeout zone plus entry/50%TP/direction, and carries
        named_in_path_detail / unnamed_in_path_detail on the result for callers.
        NOTE: this is OBSERVABILITY ONLY — the gate behaviour is unchanged. What the
        block SHOULD do (skip / trade-to-pool / enter reduced) is still open.
