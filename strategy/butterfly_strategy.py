strategy/butterfly_strategy.py  v4.0
Butterfly construction and debit ceiling.

v4.0  2026-08-19  Ported from options_trader_v3 at the OTV4 split.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
Dated release framing and trivia are stripped; what remains is the
reasoning behind the thresholds, the design guarantees, and the
defects that recur when forgotten. WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires

strategy/butterfly_strategy.py — Debit butterfly for RANGING/COMPRESSION regimes. v3.5
BFLY.3: THE DEBIT CEILING IS FLAT AT 0.50. CONVICTION IS OUT.
        Max profit is `wing - debit`, so 0.50 is the STRUCTURE'S OWN BREAK-EVEN
        - risk equals reward there, above it the payoff is upside-down. Not a
        fitted number: no holdout needed, cannot be overfit.
        MEASURED FLEET-WIDE (29 boxes) AND IT REFUTED BOTH CANDIDATE DESIGNS.
        conv->ratio slope is POSITIVE on 5 of 7 sampled symbols (AVGO +0.103,
        GS +2.550, NVDA +0.109, PLTR +0.038, QQQ +0.211; only SMH -0.048 and
        TLT -0.031 negative) - higher conviction travels with MORE EXPENSIVE
        tents, so scaling the ceiling up with conviction paid more exactly where
        the trade was WORSE, and INVERTING it would have been worse still.
        AND IT COST TRADES: SMH had 46 setups at mean ratio 0.379 and fired 3,
        because conviction averaged 0.033 and pinned the ceiling to its 0.33
        floor. AVGO 1 of 5, QQQ 1 of 27, MSFT 1 of 2.
        THE REJECTS STILL DO THE WORK - NVDA 0.718, PLTR 0.799, NFLX 0.941 and
        TLT 1.029 stay refused on PRICE. `_conv` is still journaled so the
        relationship stays measurable; it simply no longer gates. The old
        constants remain in config unread, so a revert is one line.
AC: find_strike's "no liquid contract" path was a SILENT
        return, killing a butterfly that had already cleared the GEX-pin and
        regime gates. It now logs the target strike, how many contracts were
        examined, and that none were priced.
NameError: `_mult` referenced on line 190 after the
        conviction-scaled proximity multiplier was reverted to a fixed 1x EM and
        the variable removed. Raised on EVERY butterfly evaluation, but only a
        box in COMPRESSION reaches that gate — so IWM restarted twice while the
        other 14 boxes ran the same code without a scratch. Second orphaned-
        variable NameError in two days (continuation `mid`, 07-29); both were
        caught only by a live box crashing. `tests/test_no_undefined_names.py`
        now fails the suite on any undefined name, which catches both.
v3.0 — original release
DOC SYNC (no logic change): the header described
        BUTTERFLY_ENTRY_CUTOFF_ET as a "hard exit at 2:00 PM". It is an ENTRY
        cutoff only and is not consulted by exit_engine at all. Corrected.
DISCOUNT GATE (relabeled in the 2026-07-23 header audit —
        shipped mis-numbered v1.4 after v3.1 already existed): net_debit ≤ BUTTERFLY_MAX_DEBIT_PCT_WIDTH ×
        wing width (config, prior 0.33 ≈ min 2:1 RR). Encodes the operator's
        thesis — enter the pin-centered tent while price is still a walk away
        and the fly is cheap — as the risk:reward stated directly, instead of
        a delta proxy (whipsaws on 0DTE gamma; dies with the Greeks feed).
        Ratio logged on every evaluation for ledger calibration.
GEX pin center strike, fixed wings by instrument,
        noon-2PM entry window, one-per-session limit, TP at 20%
repo-wide v3.0 bump: Yahoo-Finance purge & data stream
        mapping optimization (all market data now flows from the single
        shared TastyTrade candle feed — see data/candle_feed.py). No logic
        change in this file.
Entry logic:
  - Only fires between 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM ET
  - Only one butterfly per RTH session
  - Requires GEX environment to be PINNING
  - Price must be within 1× expected move of GEX pin strike
  - Center strike = GEX pin strike (not ATM)
  - Wings: 25 points on SPX, $5 on QQQ/SPY (fixed, not ATR-based)
  - Direction (call vs put) based on VWAP bias
Exit logic:
  - TP: 20% of max profit
  - SL: 25% of net debit
  - Entry cutoff: 2:00 PM ET (BUTTERFLY_ENTRY_CUTOFF_ET). This is an ENTRY
    gate only — it is NOT a hard exit. An open butterfly exits on: regime
    flip to trending, 2.5h max hold, 25% stop, 20% target, or the 15:45
    hard close. Whichever fires first.
  - Max hold: 2.5 hours
v-convdiscount — 2026-07-28 — THE DISCOUNT CEILING IS EARNED BY CONVICTION.
        MEASURED, not inferred. QQQ's full log: debit ratios 0.41-0.64 (min 0.41,
        cluster 0.47-0.53) against a FLAT 0.33 ceiling -> the gate rejected 100%
        of setups that reached it. Three butterflies exist in the whole fleet
        archive (07-09, 07-20, 07-24). Ruled out first: VIX (16.0-18.2, under the
        20 disable), regime (COMPRESSION/RANGING, valid), GEX (QQQ logs 708
        PINNING ticks, real 0.4-1.0M magnitudes), and PROXIMITY -- gate 6 logged
        ZERO "too far from pin" rejections ever, so it was never binding and
        scaling it would have admitted nothing.
        The tent is expensive because price sits near the pin. With high
        conviction it STAYS pinned, paying more is justified; with low conviction,
        demand the cheap tent. The ceiling now scales 0.33 (conv <= 0.30) to 0.50
        (conv >= 0.55); at the observed median conviction 0.438 the gate is 0.42,
        which admits the cheapest observed setups. Bounds are set against the
        OBSERVED conviction range (0.000-0.582), NOT a nominal 0-1.
        Knobs OT_BFLY_DEBIT_HICONV / OT_BFLY_DISC_CONV_LO / _HI are env-
        overridable. Every evaluation logs
        "Butterfly discount gate: conv= ratio= gate= ... PASS|REJECT"
        so accepts AND rejects are both on the ledger.
