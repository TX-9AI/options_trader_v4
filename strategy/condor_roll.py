Condor roll handling.

v4.0  2026-08-19  Ported from options_trader_v3 at the OTV4 split.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
Dated release framing and trivia are stripped; what remains is the
reasoning behind the thresholds, the design guarantees, and the
defects that recur when forgotten. WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires
this block be read before the file is edited.

strategy/condor_roll.py — Broken-wing roll of a live iron condor. v1.1
AC: the missing-mark path was a SILENT return. This one
        declines a roll on a LIVE position with one side already tested — the
        roll IS the risk-reduction step, so a quiet refusal is the most
        consequential of the three silent declines. Now names which leg had no
        mark and states the position was left as-is.
paper roll credit routed through limit_ladder
        .paper_fill_credit (audit defect T): the rolled vertical applied
        PAPER_FILL_SLIPPAGE_PCT inline, one of the two credit paths that kept
        a haircut after entry_engine v3.8 dropped it for debits. One authority,
        one knob (default 0.0 = book the mark). Same 4dp precision as before;
        no live-path change.
ROLL IS REAL (audit defect P). Step 1 (close old untested
        vertical): both modes route through place_exit_order and book the
        FillResult's ACTUAL fill price — the old code booked plan.close_cost
        even when the confirmed live fill differed. Step 2 (open rolled
        vertical): a REAL signed-credit limit order is placed and
        fill-confirmed via execution/order_confirm — the old code wrote the
        DB record without placing ANY live order (a fictional position). The
        record books ONLY confirmed contracts at the broker's net credit;
        paper mirrors live friction via PAPER_FILL_SLIPPAGE_PCT. If the open
        fails after the close succeeded, position-truth is preserved (DB
        matches broker), a HALF-COMPLETE page fires, and the roll re-evaluates
        on a later tick with a fresh plan. The risk-free claim is re-checked
        against the ACTUAL fill credit and pages if the fills came in light.
FillResult adoption: the live roll-close of the untested
        vertical now goes through the confirmed-fill contract (place_exit_order
        returns FillResult); the roll aborts and leaves the position OPEN unless
        the close is broker-confirmed, instead of treating order submission as a
        completed close. No paper-path change.
initial build.
repo-wide v3.0 bump: Yahoo-Finance purge & data stream
        mapping optimization (all market data now flows from the single
        shared TastyTrade candle feed — see data/candle_feed.py). No logic
        change in this file.
When BOTH condor verticals are open and price tests ONE side, a professional
adjustment is to roll the UNTESTED side toward price to collect additional
credit. If the cumulative credit collected covers the tested side's width, the
tested side becomes RISK-FREE — the structure is now a broken-wing butterfly.
Risk-free condition (the whole point):
    total_credit_collected  >=  tested_side_width
    (both in per-share terms; ×100 is the dollar figure)
    where total_credit_collected = banked_condor_credit
                                   + roll_credit (new untested vertical)
                                   - close_cost  (buying back the old untested vertical)
This module:
  1. classify_tested()      — which side is being tested, which is untested.
  2. find_risk_free_roll()  — pure premium math over live chain marks; finds the
                              smallest roll of the untested side that makes the
                              tested side risk-free (smallest roll = least new
                              risk on the rolled side).
  3. check_and_execute_roll() — orchestrator: detect, solve, and (only if a
                              risk-free roll exists) execute it, marking the
                              result a broken wing.
HARD CONTRACT: the roll is the FINAL adjustment. Once rolled, every leg is
flagged is_broken_wing=1 and this module never touches it again — it is managed
to exit only (stop / target / nickel), no further rolls.
