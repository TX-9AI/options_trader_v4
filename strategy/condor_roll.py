strategy/condor_roll.py  v4.6
v4.6  2026-08-26  r146 — THE ROLL HAS A PLAN. `check_and_execute_roll` writes
      a `CreditRoll` row through strategy/plan.py at every decision: HOLD
      (no paired condor / already final form / neither side tested / no
      risk-free roll — with the best candidate's roll_credit, close_cost,
      credit_after and tested_width, the "economical question" the operator
      named), ROLL when executed, NO PLAN when the chain is absent. The roll
      logic is unchanged; this narrates the decision it already makes.
      Operator: *"we are already trying to find the farthest strike that
      satisfies the economical question & that is worthy of a tick by tick
      plan."*
v4.5  2026-08-24  r106 THE TENT — operator's post-roll escalation, combining his
      rungs 2 and 3: on a 1-min CLOSE beyond a short strike of an already-rolled
      structure, take the PROFITABLE side off (computed from marks, never
      assumed) and buy a long of the OPPOSITE type, equidistant from the
      remaining short as its wing — "leaving price under the tent". Priced
      BEFORE it is paid: if the hedge's debit alone breaches the 15% floor on
      cumulative credit, the tent is not built and the structure closes. The
      survivor is re-booked as Structure.TENT carrying the CUMULATIVE credit, so
      the floor measures the whole adjusted position.
v4.4  2026-08-24  r105: the roll's OPEN half walks the ladder WITHIN THIS CALL.
      It cannot walk across ticks — by the time the open runs, the old untested
      vertical is already closed, so check_and_execute_roll sees len(legs)!=2
      next tick and never re-enters; an unfilled rung would strand the position
      half-rolled with the tested side unhedged. Bounded rungs in-line, ending
      at mark (the pre-r105 price), each with a short deadline.
v4.3  2026-08-25  r65 EXORCISM: every mention of the retired classification
      system removed - identifiers, comments, docstrings, schema. The word
      does not appear in this tree. Full accounting: REMOVAL_LOG (delivery).


v4.2  2026-08-21  PHASE B (r58): the rolled record no longer wears RANGING.
Condor roll handling.

v4.1  2026-08-20  AUDIT F8: a light-filled roll no longer wears the risk-free
      label - on shortfall the ladder stays ARMED and is_broken_wing is NOT
      set; the alert states both.
v4.0  2026-08-19  Ported from options_trader_v3 at the OTV4 split.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
Dated release framing and trivia are stripped; what remains is the
reasoning behind the thresholds, the design guarantees, and the
defects that recur when forgotten. WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires
this block be read before the file is edited.

strategy/condor_roll.py — Broken-wing roll of a live iron condor. v1.1
AC: the missing-mark path was a SILENT return. This one
        declines a roll on a LIVE position with one side already tested — the
        roll IS the risk-reduction step, so a quiet refusal is the most
        consequential of the three silent declines. Now names which leg had no
        mark and states the position was left as-is.
paper roll credit routed through limit_ladder
        .paper_fill_credit (audit defect T): the rolled vertical applied
        PAPER_FILL_SLIPPAGE_PCT inline, one of the two credit paths that kept
        a haircut after entry_engine v3.8 dropped it for debits. One authority,
        one knob (default 0.0 = book the mark). Same 4dp precision as before;
        no live-path change.
ROLL IS REAL (audit defect P). Step 1 (close old untested
        vertical): both modes route through place_exit_order and book the
        FillResult's ACTUAL fill price — the old code booked plan.close_cost
        even when the confirmed live fill differed. Step 2 (open rolled
        vertical): a REAL signed-credit limit order is placed and
        fill-confirmed via execution/order_confirm — the old code wrote the
        DB record without placing ANY live order (a fictional position). The
        record books ONLY confirmed contracts at the broker's net credit;
        paper mirrors live friction via PAPER_FILL_SLIPPAGE_PCT. If the open
        fails after the close succeeded, position-truth is preserved (DB
        matches broker), a HALF-COMPLETE page fires, and the roll re-evaluates
        on a later tick with a fresh plan. The risk-free claim is re-checked
        against the ACTUAL fill credit and pages if the fills came in light.
FillResult adoption: the live roll-close of the untested
        vertical now goes through the confirmed-fill contract (place_exit_order
        returns FillResult); the roll aborts and leaves the position OPEN unless
        the close is broker-confirmed, instead of treating order submission as a
        completed close. No paper-path change.
initial build.
repo-wide v3.0 bump: Yahoo-Finance purge & data stream
        mapping optimization (all market data now flows from the single
        shared TastyTrade candle feed — see data/candle_feed.py). No logic
        change in this file.
When BOTH condor verticals are open and price tests ONE side, a professional
adjustment is to roll the UNTESTED side toward price to collect additional
credit. If the cumulative credit collected covers the tested side's width, the
tested side becomes RISK-FREE — the structure is now a broken-wing butterfly.
Risk-free condition (the whole point):
    total_credit_collected  >=  tested_side_width
    (both in per-share terms; ×100 is the dollar figure)
    where total_credit_collected = banked_condor_credit
                                   + roll_credit (new untested vertical)
                                   - close_cost  (buying back the old untested vertical)
This module:
  1. classify_tested()      — which side is being tested, which is untested.
  2. find_risk_free_roll()  — pure premium math over live chain marks; finds the
                              smallest roll of the untested side that makes the
                              tested side risk-free (smallest roll = least new
                              risk on the rolled side).
  3. check_and_execute_roll() — orchestrator: detect, solve, and (only if a
                              risk-free roll exists) execute it, marking the
                              result a broken wing.
HARD CONTRACT: the roll is the FINAL adjustment. Once rolled, every leg is
flagged is_broken_wing=1 and this module never touches it again — it is managed
to exit only (stop / target / nickel), no further rolls.

# r106 — THE TENT. Operator's spec, 2026-08-24, read back and confirmed.
# ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# "If we've already rolled & price breaches the new structure, take off the
#  profitable side, leaving a lone vertical. Purchase a long position
#  equidistant from the short strike as the other long strike, leaving price
#  under the 'tent.' The only remaining adjustment after that should be a 15%
#  floor of the total credit collected. If we can't achieve that, close the
#  entire structure. Close it also if purchasing the new long strike gets us to
#  -15% loss."
#
# WORKED EXAMPLE (the one this was read back against):
#   condor 95/90 put + 105/110 call, price ~100. Call side tested, put side
#   rolled up to 100/95. Price closes above 105 — the breach.
#   → take off the profitable (rolled put) vertical
#   → keep 105/110 call
#   → existing wing is +5 from the short, so the hedge goes -5: a LONG PUT at
#     100. Longs at 100 and 110 bracket price at ~106.
#
# ⚠️ THE HEDGE IS THE OPPOSITE TYPE, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT. A long CALL at
# 100 against short 105 / long 110 goes NET LONG above 110 — uncapped on the far
# tail. A long PUT at 100 caps the upside at width−credit and PAYS if price
# collapses back through. The operator chose the hedge after the payoff of both
# was worked through; it is his ruling on my analysis, not his original spec,
# and it is recorded that way deliberately.
#
# ⚠️ "PROFITABLE" IS COMPUTED, NOT ASSUMED. Which side is winning follows from
# the marks. Deciding it from which side we LABELLED tested would encode a
# reading of "breaches the new structure" that was never pinned down — price
# continuing through the original short, or reversing through the rolled one.
# Reading the book answers it for both cases and neither of us has to be right.
# ⚠️ BREACH = A 1-MIN CANDLE CLOSE BEYOND A SHORT STRIKE. Operator's definition.
# A wick is a touch, not a decision — the same rule the ORB structure stop uses.

    an orphan. Doing it the other way round would leave a bought hedge attached
    to a structure we then failed to simplify.
