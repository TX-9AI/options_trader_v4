strategy/iron_condor_strategy.py  v4.1
v4.1  2026-08-25  r65 EXORCISM: every mention of the retired classification
      system removed - identifiers, comments, docstrings, schema. The word
      does not appear in this tree. Full accounting: REMOVAL_LOG (delivery).

Two-leg condor with ladder. TRIGGER REBUILT IN PHASE 2.

v4.0  2026-08-19  Ported from options_trader_v3 at the OTV4 split.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
Dated release framing and trivia are stripped; what remains is the
reasoning behind the thresholds, the design guarantees, and the
defects that recur when forgotten. WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires
this block be read before the file is edited.

v-str1 2026-08-18  STR.1: the leg signal now carries VIX, via a new
    `CondorPlan.vix_at_plan`. Neither this strategy nor continuation set
    `vix_at_signal`, and they are the two HIGHEST-VOLUME strategies, so
    `trades.vix_at_entry` fell to its REAL DEFAULT 0.0 on **58% of the book**.
    The separation probe read that default as a measured value and reported
    "58% ties, median 0.000 in both arms" - indistinguishable from "VIX does not
    separate outcomes". A COLLECTION GAP WEARING THE COSTUME OF A NULL.
    PLAN-TIME, AND THE NAME SAYS SO. `_build_leg_signal` has no `macro` in
    scope: the plan is built while macro is available, then legs fire minutes or
    hours later on a price trigger. Threading `macro` into the builder would
    have delivered a plan-time snapshot anyway, so it rides on the plan
    explicitly rather than pretending to be fill-time.
v-a2 — 2026-08-15 — AUDIT A2.2: the orphan once-latch re-arms daily —
    _orphan_said only reset on process start, so a second orphan on a later
    day of the same process would have stayed silent.
v-pfanchor — 2026-08-13 — PF.5: THE PITCHFORK BECOMES THE CONDOR'S ANCHOR, and
  this is the overlay's FIRST CONSUMER. It has been live as a weight-0 observer
  since 2026-08-12 with one call site and nothing reading the rails back.
  OPERATOR'S SPEC, verbatim where it matters:
    · "It's a guardrail, not the road."  -> DAILY fork only.
    · "consider the condor off the table if we don't have guardrails. That is
       the insurance policy that eliminates a bad decision in an unpredictable
       session."                          -> NO FORK, NO PLAN.
    · "The tine should be the trigger for 'rich premium' and the short strike
       should be just outside the range of the rail at the MOST LIQUID strike
       WHERE PRICE HAS STILL NOT EXCEEDED."
    · leg order from the apparent slope: an UP-sloping fork fills the PUT side
       first (price travels lower rail -> upper rail over the session), a
       DOWN-sloping fork fills the CALL side first. Mirrored, and it falls out
       of the geometry rather than being asserted.
  THREE THINGS THIS CHANGES AND ONE IT DOES NOT:
   (1) ANCHOR — short call rides the UPPER rail, short put the LOWER rail,
       replacing the BB half of the dual floor. `0.80 * EM` SURVIVES AS A
       MINIMUM DISTANCE: a rail sitting on top of spot must not produce a strike
       with no breathing room, which is the exact failure v-dualfloor was
       written to fix after ~3 weeks of bleed.
   (2) NOT-EXCEEDED — a strike price has ALREADY TRADED THROUGH today is a
       strike the market has proven it can reach. New constraint; nothing in the
       codebase tested a short strike against the session's own extremes before.
   (3) LIQUIDITY NOW KEYS ON BID/ASK WIDTH. The old `liq()` summed
       `open_interest + volume`, and factor_sweep found BOTH CONSTANT across the
       whole joined sample — so `max_liq` was 0, the `else: top = eligible`
       branch took every call, and "most liquid" has silently resolved to
       "nearest the floor" since v-dualfloor shipped. The comment even
       anticipated it ("no OI/vol data"), which is why it degraded quietly
       instead of failing. Width is populated and is also the measure that
       matters on a 0DTE credit spread, where a nickel-wide quote is what trips
       a stop on noise. OI/volume are kept ONLY as a tie-break, and only when
       genuinely non-zero.
   (4) UNCHANGED: the RANGING gate, the leg-2 pause, the ratchet, the nickel
       close, the 11:11 window. This is strike SELECTION and leg ORDER, not a
       new trade.
  ⚠️ ACCEPTED RISK, operator's words: "If it gets breached, then our fork may
     also become invalid & I can live with that because we are accepting that
     risk for an asymmetric payoff if it holds." So a breach and a fork
     invalidation are THE SAME EVENT — the structure and the overlay agree on
     when the thesis died instead of arguing about it.
v-audibleabandon — 2026-08-05 — `_journal_abandon`'s handler logs inside its
  except body. Flagged by the swallow census as a new TIER-1 silent handler the
  morning after it shipped. The swallow itself is correct and unchanged — a
  journal failure must never reach the trading loop — but a bare `pass` makes
  "deliberate" and "accidental" indistinguishable to the audit, which is the
  whole point of the audit.
v-approachalways — 2026-08-04 — APPROACH TELEMETRY ON EVERY PLAN DEATH.
  The numbers already existed and were UNREACHABLE. `max_price_seen` /
  `min_price_seen` are tracked from a plan's first tick and
  `_abandon_past_cutoff` reported them — but only on the CUTOFF path.
  Measured fleet-wide 2026-08-04: 23 plans, 23 deaths, **cutoff fired ZERO
  times**; every plan died on CANCELLED-before-Leg-1, which reported nothing
  price get?" sat behind the one door that never opens.
  WHAT IT UNBLOCKS — item AI, and the two answers need OPPOSITE fixes:
  an approach fraction near ZERO means the trigger sits where price never goes
  on this tape (the MIDPOINT is wrong — pitchfork/VWAP anchor work); near 0.6
  means it is merely a little too far (CONDOR_TRIGGER_APPROACH is a parameter
  to fit). A plan that reports only its cause of death cannot tell them apart.
  Both death paths now log the same line and emit a `condor_abandon` journal
  row, so the fleet answer is a JOIN rather than a night of greps.
  WHY THE LIFETIME DATA MATTERS FOR READING IT: the same session showed plan
  lifetimes of 1-94 minutes, median ~30, several running 88-94. These plans
  were ALIVE across most of the window — so a low approach is not "no time",
  it is "price never went there".
v-declineloud — 2026-07-31 — AC: the "no liquid strike beyond dual floor" path
  was a SILENT return. On 2026-07-30 `grep -c "no liquid strike"` returned 0
  across all history and was read as "the dual floor never rejects" — it
  actually meant "the dual floor rejects in silence". Now logs the floor level,
  how many contracts were priced, and the nearest priced strike.
v-holdcompression + v-selfdiag — 2026-07-30 — TWO CHANGES, both about a plan
  that dies without saying anything.
  (1) HOLD ON COMPRESSION. Any non-RANGING tick used to cancel an un-filled
      plan; CVX lost three in one session to COMPRESSION alone, each after ~19
      minutes, so none reached the entry cutoff. Compression is a TIGHTENING
      range — where a neutral short-premium structure most belongs — so it is
      now a HOLD, as are SWEEP_REVERSAL and UNKNOWN. Only TRENDING_*/BREAKOUT
      cancel. Mirrors Leg 2's pause-and-hold since v3.2.
  (2) SELF-DIAGNOSING ABANDONMENT. The cutoff line now reports how far price
      travelled toward each trigger, the high-water marks, and EM at plan vs at
      abandonment — because holding through compression means waiting to sell
      into CONTRACTING premium, and strikes are validated against EM once and
      never re-checked. Makes the anchor question (VWAP? pitchfork median?)
      answerable with a number instead of an argument.
  cut had HOLD first, which meant a held plan returned early every tick and never
  reached the cutoff at all. Caught by test, not by reasoning.
v-dualfloor + v-indep-legs — 2026-07-28 — TWO FIXES to strike selection and legging.
  (1) STRIKE FLOOR: short strike must clear BOTH 0.80*expected_move from spot
      AND the BB band (whichever is farther). The old code anchored to the BB
      band, had a fallback that placed strikes INSIDE the band when nothing
      liquid sat outside, and only rejected strikes that were too FAR — there
      was NO minimum-distance floor. It sold calls/puts on top of spot with no
      room to breathe (~3 weeks of bleed). Verified against the 2026-07-28
      entries: all six sold at 6-28% of EM; the 0.80 floor rejects every one.
      `_select_beyond_floor` keeps the liquidity-based selection but biases
      OUTWARD and has NO inside fallback — no liquid strike beyond the floor
      means the leg is SKIPPED, never sold close.
  (2) INDEPENDENT LEGS: the call and put sides are independent credit spreads
      sharing a plan. Both triggers are checked EVERY tick; whichever side's
      conditions are met fires, regardless of order. Previously leg 2 was
      state-gated behind leg 1, so if price only ever visited leg 2's side that
      leg never fired at all. call_filled/put_filled tracked separately;
      COMPLETE only when both are in. leg1/leg2 now mean only first/second to
      fill (preserved for the entry_engine interface and the roll path).
LEG 2 PAUSES INSTEAD OF CANCELLING on a non-RANGING tick,
        and its short strike is RE-DERIVED from the CURRENT bands at fire time
        rather than the value frozen at plan time. Rationale: if price wanders
        for 40 minutes the plan-time strike is stale, so the second side would
        not actually be premium-rich when it fires. The strike should be a
        consequence of where the band is NOW.
FIX missing import (latent since v1.0, 2026-06-30):
        OptionContract/OptionsChain were referenced in CondorPlan's dataclass
        annotations and in method signatures but never imported. Python 3.14's
        lazy annotation evaluation (PEP 649) masked it on the fleet; on any
        Python <= 3.13 the module raises NameError at import, which kills
        main.py at startup (verified 3.12 vs 3.14 A/B on the identical tree).
        One import line added, matching the canonical form used by
        base_strategy.py and gex_data.py. No logic change.
initial release (simultaneous entry placeholder)
full redesign: legged entry via price-triggered verticals.
docstring/comment cleanup: strike selection is BB-band
        anchored ONLY (no delta anywhere in the code). Removed stale
        "delta-primary" / "delta as secondary" / "falls back to delta-primary"
        wording that contradicted the implementation and the architecture
        decision. No logic change.
repo-wide v3.0 bump: Yahoo-Finance purge & data stream
        mapping optimization (all market data now flows from the single
        shared TastyTrade candle feed — see data/candle_feed.py). No logic
        change in this file.
Strategy design:
  At decision time, the bot identifies both vertical spread strike locations
  by anchoring the short strikes to the Bollinger Band boundaries (short call
  at/just outside the BB upper band, short put at/just outside the BB lower
  band), with an ATM straddle-based expected-move sanity guardrail. No delta
  targeting is used. No order is placed yet.
  Leg 1 fires when price reaches within CONDOR_PROXIMITY_STRIKES of the
  first side's short strike — whichever side price is moving toward first.
  (e.g. short call at 7545 → leg 1 fires when price hits 7540, 2 strikes away)
  Leg 2 is queued after Leg 1 fills. It fires when price reaches within
  CONDOR_PROXIMITY_STRIKES of the opposite side's short strike.
  before a leg fires, that pending leg is permanently cancelled. An
  already-filled leg stays open and manages independently — it is NEVER
  cancelled after the order is placed.
  Exit per leg: 25% stop loss OR close at $0.05 (nickel) — whichever
  comes first. No take-profit target, no trail, no BOS. Hold to nickel
  or stop, independently per leg.
  If Leg 2 never fires (price never approached the second side before
  close), Leg 1 remains as a standalone vertical and manages the same way.
State machine:
  IDLE -> DECIDED (both strikes identified, watching for Leg 1 trigger)
       -> LEG1_TRIGGERED (Leg 1 order placed, waiting for fill)
       -> LEG1_FILLED (Leg 1 live, Leg 2 queued, watching for Leg 2 trigger)
       -> LEG2_TRIGGERED (Leg 2 order placed, waiting for fill)
       -> COMPLETE (both legs filled — full iron condor assembled)
