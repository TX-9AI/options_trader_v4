v4.8  2026-09-01  r208 — THE WING IS SEARCHED, THE FLOOR MUST CLEAR THE
      SPREAD, AND RELAXED IS GONE FROM THIS STRATEGY.
      🔴 2026-09-01: five flies fired at 12:00:00 and three were stopped out
      INSIDE THE SAME MINUTE — META 577.5 debit 0.17 (25% floor = 4.3c), CRM
      0.21 (5.3c), MU 0.28 (7.0c). A fly's value is `lower + upper -
      2*center`, a small difference of three larger numbers, so THREE legs of
      quote noise compound into a figure itself worth 17 cents. They were not
      stopped by price; they were stopped by their own marks.
      🔑 R AND SURVIVABILITY PULL OPPOSITE WAYS AND ONLY R WAS WIRED. R rises
      as the wing narrows; survivability falls. So the selector steered to the
      LEAST survivable structure available and called it best — META at R 10.8
      was not a fly that happened to be fragile, it was the most fragile
      constructible fly, chosen because it was. Both bounds together require
      width >= 64 x leg-spread, so on a wide-spread symbol NO wing qualifies,
      which is reported as a definite answer rather than a fallback.
      · `stop_survivable` (r154, one caller until now — the sweep) is wired
        here as FEASIBILITY. The butterfly was not even on r154's untouched
        list because on 2026-08-27 it had never fired.
      · `WING_EM_FRAC` DELETED. The wing is searched over the chain's LISTED
        strikes — R_FLOOR caps the wide side, survivability floors the narrow
        side, narrowest qualifying wing wins. Operator: "the wings should be
        a 1-R or better (that's the widest allowed) but prefer narrower."
      · Candidates come from the strikes themselves, NOT from a stride of
        `_chain_increment`'s median gap: a mixed ladder would let the stride
        step PAST listed wings — r198's C.29 in a new costume. `inc` survives
        for reporting only.
      · RELAXED IS REMOVED ENTIRELY from this file (no widen, no window, no
        tag). Operator: "reachability and pin strength are synonymous with
        possible — if either is a no it's much less possible", and the
        butterfly is ONE PER SESSION, so relaxing a dial does not collect a
        marginal trade, it SPENDS the day's only slot on one.
      · GATES: EM_MAX_FRAC, PIN_CONC_MIN and LATEST_ET all SELECTION ->
        FOUNDATIONAL, reversing r196 on the last of those.
v4.7  2026-08-31  r198 — THE WINGS ARE SNAPPED TO THE CHAIN'S REAL STRIKE
      LADDER. `config.STRIKE_INCREMENT` is one global number for fifteen
      symbols and `round_to_strike()` returns an int, so every wing was
      quantised to whole dollars: PLTR pin 190 -> legs 189/191 on a $2.50
      ladder, AMD pin 472.5 -> legs 470.5/474.5. Neither pair exists, and the
      `legs` gate refused for 242 and 243 MINUTES on 2026-08-31 for an
      arithmetic reason, not a market one. 🔑 THE APEX NEVER MOVES — both
      pins were listed strikes; only the wings were off-grid, so the
      nearest-strike-substitute doctrine is untouched. ⚠️ A wider-than-
      intended wing is ACCEPTED by operator ruling and recorded (intended,
      grid, stretch) so the metrics can settle whether it is viable.
v4.6  2026-08-31  r196 — THE NOON FLOOR IS HARD. Operator, on the first live
      open, seeing butterflies fire at 09:45: "the noon floor is
      non-negotiable." 🔴 That 09:45 is `relaxed.window()`'s relaxed_earliest
      default EXACTLY — the fires were the relaxed floor, not a pin forming
      early. EARLIEST_ET moves SELECTION -> FOUNDATIONAL and is passed as its
      own relaxed value so it cannot widen. LATEST_ET stays relaxable.
      🔑 THE RULE THIS TEACHES: relax DIALS, never STRUCTURAL gates. A dial's
      near-misses tell you whether the line is right; a structural gate's
      "near-misses" are a different trade entirely. And think twice before
      relaxing anything on a strategy with a SESSION CAP — there, a relaxed
      gate does not collect a sample, it SPENDS the sample.
v4.5  2026-08-29  r178 — 🔴 ONE BUTTERFLY PER PIN PER SESSION. The hour
      r177 unblocked the starved atm_iv, the strategy fired the SAME UNH
      397.5 fly five times in ninety seconds: the additive exemption (r161)
      let it stack ITSELF and it had no self-lock — it had never once fired
      to need one. PLAYED_PINS registry: a fire marks the pin played (from
      the dispatch, on the signal's pin); prepare() declines a played pin
      STRUCTURALLY (relaxed does not waive it), checked before the
      conditions. A NEW pin is a new trade. In-process; a restart clears it.
v4.4  2026-08-27  r161 — THE PLAN PREPARES, THE STRATEGY EXECUTES; EXEMPT FROM
      THE SINGLE-POSITION RULE. Operator, 2026-08-27: *"I want it to be able
      to fire regardless if any other open trades are found. Reason: it has
      such a high hurdle to clear. GEX pinning, pin reachable, economic
      feasibility. If it can achieve all that, it's earned an entry."*
      `prepare()` is the plan (the sweep's v4.6 shape): DORMANT outside the
      slot; each declared CONDITION with its current reading; the three legs
      SELECTED (apex on the pin, wing from the expected move, exact strikes);
      R = (width-debit)/debit against R_FLOOR as a STRUCTURAL check — the
      operator's third hurdle, so relaxed does not waive it (v4.3 routed it
      through the muteable hurdle; that was wrong for a trade whose entry
      is EARNED by feasibility). `generate_signal()` executes the prepared
      legs. main.py v4.19 asks it every tick of its slot whether or not a
      position is open, and appends its record (position_manager v4.4).
v4.3  2026-08-26  r147 — UNPARKED, AND IT HAS LEGS. Operator: *"I want it
      active. It already has to clear a high bar to fire. The r-value in
      strict should veto, but allow and record on relaxed. The pin should be
      reachable & the strikes should be relatively narrow but not so narrow
      that it has zero breathing room. Purchased as a debit call butterfly
      for below the pin, and put for [above] the pin."*
      · `ENABLED` now reads config.GEX_BUTTERFLY_ENABLED, default ON.
      · THE LEGS: apex ON the pin; wings at ⟨PRIOR⟩ WING_EM_FRAC (0.25) of
        the expected move, rounded to the strike increment, floor ONE
        increment (breathing room), ceiling the distance to the pin (the
        near wing never crosses spot). Call fly when spot is BELOW the pin,
        put fly when spot is ABOVE it — price travels to the magnet.
      · EXACT STRIKES ONLY. `select_butterfly_strikes` centres on spot and
        falls back to the nearest liquid strike; both would silently move the
        apex off the pin, which is the FOUNDATIONAL condition. Three priced
        contracts at exactly lower/pin/upper, or no trade.
      · net_debit = lower.mark − 2·center.mark + upper.mark; max_profit =
        width − debit; R = (width − debit)/debit through the plan, so STRICT
        vetoes below 1:1 and RELAXED records (`r_muted`). debit/width is
        recorded against BUTTERFLY_MAX_DEBIT_PCT_WIDTH as a check, NOT a
        gate — the R hurdle is the economic gate, one rule fleet-wide.
      · The signal is now VALID: is_butterfly, three contracts, direction,
        net_debit — `is_valid`'s butterfly arm is satisfied and
        entry_engine's `_place_butterfly` runs it unchanged.
v4.2  2026-08-26  r146 — THE PLAN IS WIRED. Every refusal (parked, no GEX,
      not PINNING, pin strength, window, no expected move, pin too near/far)
      goes through `self.planner` (strategy/plan.py) and writes a DECLINE row
      naming the gate; `_gate()` kept as an alias. ⚠️ THE WHAT-IF IS NOT
      PRICED HERE YET, DELIBERATELY: this spec sets `center_strike` and never
      selects the three legs, so the signal cannot be valid (`is_butterfly`
      is never set; the single-leg `is_valid` arm needs a strike and premium
      it does not have) — the same one-writer-zero-readers defect r97 found
      in the sweep and r146 found in the runaway. Building the legs is a
      spec decision (which wing width, how far from the pin) and is NOT made
      here; until it is, R records n/a and the hurdle is not consulted.
      Parked anyway (ENABLED False), so nothing trades on it.
Apex on the GEX pin, OUT OF THE MONEY. Buy the move to the magnet.

v4.0  2026-08-19  First version. **The wrong trade** - see v4.1.
v4.1  2026-08-20  Rewritten to the operator's actual spec.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires this block be read before the file is edited.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
⚠️ STILL PARKED. THE INPUT IS NOT REAL YET.
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
`OptionContract.open_interest` was a DECLARED FIELD WITH NO PRODUCER - 0 on
every contract for the life of v3 - so `gex_data` fell through to
`oi_proxy = max(1, int(1000 * gamma))` and multiplied by gamma AGAIN:

        **GEX ~ 100,000 * gamma^2 * spot**

Confirmed on the live SPX box 2026-08-19: 542 of 542 contracts in the day's
final snapshot carried `"oi": 0`, while the log showed `pin = call_wall = $7725`
with **spot sitting on it** - gamma peaks at the money, so a gamma-squared
surface always "pins" wherever price already is - and GEX swung
**12.4M -> 0.1M -> 2.0M in three minutes**, flipping PINNING/NEUTRAL inside 90
seconds. OI.1 wires real open interest into both repos; ~2 weeks of collection
are needed before any threshold here can be validated.

⚠️ **AND THAT ALSO HID A DUPLICATE.** v3's `butterfly_strategy` centres on SPOT;
this centres on the PIN. **While GEX was gamma-squared the pin WAS spot, so the
two computed the same centre through different arithmetic and nobody could have
noticed.** They diverge for the first time when real OI lands. One of them
retires then; keeping both is how a codebase grows a second lineage nobody
remembers choosing.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
WHAT v4.0 GOT WRONG, AND WHY THE CORRECTION MATTERS
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
v4.0 built an AT-THE-MONEY butterfly requiring price to be NEAR the pin already,
and vetoed high ATR because "a butterfly wants price to sit still". **Both
backwards.**

Operator, 2026-08-20: *"the intention of this trade is to place the apex on the
pin, which should be OUT OF THE MONEY ... and the farther away the better as
long as it's within the expected move. That's where the asymmetrical payoff
comes into play."*

**THE ASYMMETRY IS THE ENTIRE TRADE.** A butterfly's apex payoff is fixed at the
wing width, but **the DEBIT falls sharply as the apex moves OTM.** A pin at 80%
of the expected move costs a fraction of one at 20% and pays the same at the
apex. Same maximum payoff, much smaller stake.

So distance is the EDGE, not the risk, and the gate is a BAND:
  · too NEAR  - expensive, poor ratio, and you are paying for a move that has
                already happened
  · too FAR   - beyond the expected move, the chain says price probably cannot
                get there
  · **prefer the far edge of what is reachable**

⚠️ AND THE PIN-STRENGTH CONDITION BECOMES LOAD-BEARING. At 80% of the expected
move the trade relies on the magnet actually PULLING price, not on drift
happening to arrive. **A weak pin far away is the worst cell in the matrix; a
strong pin far away is the best.** `pin_concentration` is what tells them apart
- a strike holding 40% of gross |GEX| is one dominant magnet, one holding 8% is
gamma smeared with nothing pinned, **and both read "PINNING"** past the 0.15
threshold.

⚠️ THE EXPECTED MOVE COMES FROM THE CHAIN, NOT FROM VIX. v3 computed it as
`underlying * VIX/100 * sqrt(hours/6.5) / sqrt(252)` - **VIX is SPX 30-day
implied vol applied to any symbol on any 0DTE horizon.** The chain carries
per-symbol ATM IV directly and that is the right input; the time-scaling from v3
is kept because it is sound.

⚠️ AND NOTE WHAT IS *NOT* HERE: NO ATR GATE. v4.0 vetoed above 0.08% ATR on
short-vol reasoning. This trade needs price to TRAVEL to the pin and then sit -
closer to the runaway's requirement than to a short-vol one. The expected-move
band already encodes reachability using the chain's own volatility estimate,
which is a better instrument than an ATR proxy for the same question.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
GATE CATEGORIES — required by WA §36. Only SELECTION is ever relaxed.
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
**FOUNDATIONAL — never relaxed.**
  · `gex_environment == PINNING`. Without a pin there is no magnet and this is
    an arbitrary OTM butterfly.
  · the apex sits ON the pin. Centring anywhere else is a different trade -
    v3's `butterfly_strategy` centres on SPOT, and that is the duplicate this
    file exists to replace.
  · the pin is OTM. An ATM apex is v4.0's mistake: it pays for a move that has
    already happened and discards the asymmetry that justifies the structure.

**SELECTION — relaxed.**
  · pin concentration 0.25 -> 0.15 floor 0.10. ⚠️ RELAXED WITH RELUCTANCE: at
    the far edge of the expected move the trade RELIES on the magnet pulling
    price. **A weak pin far away is the worst cell in the matrix.** It is
    selection rather than foundational only because a weak pin still IS a pin.
  · window 11:00-15:00 -> 09:45-15:30.
  · EM ceiling 1.00 -> 1.30.

**FEASIBILITY — never relaxed.**
  · no ATM IV means **no trade**, not a fallback. The whole distance band is
    expressed in expected moves; guessing one would put the trade's central
    gate on a number nobody measured.
  · the EM floor at 0.30. Nearer than that the debit is expensive and the payoff
    ratio poor - **the asymmetry IS the trade**, and without it there is no
    reason to prefer this structure over anything else.

⚠️ AND THIS STRATEGY IS RARE BY DESIGN, WHICH IS AN OPPORTUNITY-COST QUESTION
RATHER THAN A DEFECT. It needs a strong pin far from spot - most likely near
monthly expiration, when real positioning sits at a strike rather than a single
day's worth. **It costs nothing while it waits**: no position slot, no capital,
no competition with the other setups. The only real cost is maintenance
attention, and a strategy that fires rarely is one whose plumbing is rarely
exercised - which is what the relaxed toggle is for.
⚠️ ITS EVIDENCE WILL BE STRUCTURAL, NOT STATISTICAL. A handful of fills a month
will never accumulate what the sweep spread got from 2,169 events. The test is
**"when it fires, does the payoff justify having kept it?"** - answerable on a
small sample in a way a win rate is not. That is a weaker footing than the sweep
spread has and it should be said before it goes live, not after a small sample
looks encouraging.

    # ⚠️ WHY THE CATEGORY WAS WRONG, WHICH IS THE PART WORTH KEEPING:
    # relaxation only informs a gate that is a DIAL ALONG A CONTINUUM. Widen a

    # the closing bell" — a claim about TIME TO EXPIRY, not about pin quality.
    # A 09:45 butterfly is not a marginally worse butterfly; it is a different
    # trade with six and a half hours of gamma ahead of it instead of four, and
    # its outcome says nothing about whether noon is the right hour.
    # ⚠️ AND THE WIDENING CAME FROM UNRELATED REASONING. `relaxed.window`'s

    # different concerns sharing one default.

    quantised to whole dollars whatever the symbol actually lists. Measured

    `_exact()` correctly refused — for 242 and 243 MINUTES respectively, on

    🔑 THE APEX WAS NEVER THE PROBLEM. PLTR's 190 and AMD's 472.5 are listed
    strikes; `_exact(pin)` would have found them. Only the WINGS were computed
    off a grid that does not exist. So this changes nothing about the apex, and
    the doctrine — *"the apex is the trade; a nearest-strike substitute is a
    different one"* — is untouched: no substitution ever reaches the apex.

    Median gap of the strikes nearest the pin. The MEDIAN, not the minimum:
    one stray half-strike listing in a $2.50 ladder would otherwise set the
    grid to 0.50 and reproduce the bug.
