strategy/relaxed.py  v4.0
The universal relaxed-entry toggle. Paper-only, loud, and it never relaxes a
gate that makes a trade impossible to win.

v4.0  2026-08-20  Built at the OTV4 split. Operator's spec.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires this block be read before the file is edited.

WHAT IT IS FOR
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Operator, 2026-08-20: *"a toggle for relaxed entry criteria ... it'll get the
trades firing so we can watch the sequence and have logs of how the trades are
firing, make sure that there's no errors, we can debug that way. And it also
gives an opportunity - presumably these won't be ideal trades - so we can watch
our stops work as intended."*

Two jobs, both real:
  1. **SURFACE PLUMBING ERRORS NO UNIT TEST FINDS.** v3's `ctx` NameError
     stopped every box trading and `import main` passed the whole time; the TCS.4
     `is_trend_credit` field crash-looped NFLX every 15 seconds. **Both were
     found by a trade attempting to fire, not by a test.** A strategy that never
     fires is a strategy whose failure modes are all still ahead of it.
  2. **EXERCISE THE STOPS ON DELIBERATELY MEDIOCRE ENTRIES.** The exits are the
     measured winners (orb_trail_stop 96% / 85 trades / +$30,696, worst -$16)
     and they deserve to be watched on trades that actually test them.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THREE RULES, AND EACH EXISTS BECAUSE OF A SPECIFIC PAST FAILURE
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
**1. IT IS LOUD, AND THE POPULATION STAYS SEPARABLE FOREVER.**
Every relaxed signal logs `RELAXED` and carries `relaxed_entry=1` on the trade
record. ⚠️ **DATA COLLECTED UNDER RELAXED CRITERIA MUST NEVER VALIDATE THE TIGHT
THRESHOLDS.** That is how a debug mode silently becomes a measurement - and this
project has already been bitten by a stand-in that was never labelled as one:
`oi_proxy = 1000 * gamma` made GEX a gamma-squared surface for the life of v3
because nothing ever said "this is not real data".

**2. IT RELAXES SELECTION, NEVER FEASIBILITY.**
Some gates say *"this setup is not ideal"*. Others say *"this trade CANNOT
WIN"*. Only the first kind may be relaxed.
⚠️ THE ATR FLOOR IS NOT NEGOTIABLE. `tests/magnitude_estimator.py`, 52,949 bars:
below **0.05% ATR** the required move was reached on **0%** of bars - not
rarely, **not once in 5,517 observations**. Relaxing it produces trades that
cannot pay regardless of how good the entry looks, which teaches nothing about
stops and pollutes the log with noise. Same for a crossed or missing quote.

**3. PAPER ONLY, GUARDED RATHER THAN TRUSTED.**
`is_allowed()` refuses when the box is live, whatever the config says. A
convention that relies on remembering to switch it off is a convention that will
one day not be remembered - and v3's own doctrine is blunt about this: **a manual
pre-shutdown step will never happen.**
