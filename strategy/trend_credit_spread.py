strategy/trend_credit_spread.py  v4.3
v4.3  2026-08-26  r146 — THE PLAN IS WIRED. This strategy had ZERO `_gate()`
      call sites and fourteen `return None`s, each with a good log line that
      never left the log. Every one now goes through `self.planner`
      (strategy/plan.py) and writes a DECLINE row naming the gate; the
      what-if is priced off the REAL spread this spec selects (short at the
      first-inside strike, wing at TCS_WING_WIDTH, credit from bid-ask):
      R = credit / (width - credit), real width, never an assumed $5. The R
      hurdle is consulted: STRICT refuses below the floor, RELAXED records
      and proceeds. The trigger/invalidation the plan records are the ORB
      bound this file already fixes; the plan moves nothing.
v4.2  2026-08-24  r100 — REMOVED `ms=""` from the OptionsSignal constructor. Not
      a field; TC.6 raised TypeError on every fire and has never produced a
      signal since r65.

v4.1  2026-08-21  r60: reads TCS_ENTRY_END_ET (inert while parked) - the
      global cutoff it used to read is deleted.
ORB-bounded credit spread. TRIGGER REBUILT IN PHASE 2.

v4.0  2026-08-19  Ported from options_trader_v3 at the OTV4 split.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
Dated release framing and trivia are stripped; what remains is the
reasoning behind the thresholds, the design guarantees, and the
defects that recur when forgotten. WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires

strategy/trend_credit_spread.py — options_trader_v3 — (TC.6)
NAMING CODIFIED, AND THE CONDOR RULES DIS-INHERITED.
        **TREND CONTINUATION** = the LONG (DEBIT) contract placed on an ORB
        runaway handoff. Blocked after 11:00 by AFD.1.
        **TREND PARTICIPATION** (this file) = a CREDIT SPREAD at the floor of a
        move, BOUNDED BY THE ORB HIGH for a long / ORB LOW for a short, and
        INVALIDATED BY A BREACH of that level. Nothing else closes it before the
        session hard close.
        THE OPERATOR'S CORRECTION THAT MATTERS: *"those levels are fixtures."*
        The ORB **ENGINE** must not gate an afternoon trade — no runaway flag,
        no slot arbitration, no `invalidation_reason`, and nothing a restart can
        erase. The ORB **LEVEL** is a price on a chart and is recomputed from
        the TAPE (`main._opening_range`). v2.0 over-corrected by removing both.
        DIS-INHERITED FROM THE CONDOR:
          · **the 0.80 x EM minimum distance.** The condor needs it because it
            sells around a PIN with no structural level; TC.6 HAS one. Since a
            strike must clear BOTH constraints, an EM floor beyond the ORB high
            would push the strike past the specified level — a FITTED
            percentage silently overriding a STRUCTURAL one.
          · **the nickel close.** A profit exit caps a position whose measured
            EV was HELD TO EXPIRY, UNMANAGED.
        ADDED: **price must be OUTSIDE the range at entry.** The exit calls a
        close back through the bound INVALIDATION, so entering while price is
        already inside means the trade is BORN IN THE STATE ITS OWN EXIT CALLS
        DEAD — the CNT.1 failure shape, which made every breakout continuation
        a one-tick artefact for a week.
        REMOVED: **the 30-minute cooldown.** It was an emergency brake during
        the rapid-fire incident and the wrong instrument for the right worry —
        the loop came from a $0.06 credit sitting one cent from a nickel close
        and one cent from a mis-set stop, all now fixed at the source. Operator:
        *"It's gated enough. The cooldown is excessive."*
        RETAINED from the condor, deliberately: quote width (liquidity is
        universal), POP >= 0.70 (the operator's own 70-80%% band, stated about
        exactly this trade), the not-exceeded session extreme, and deferral to
        an active condor plan (real deconfliction, not conflation).
AFTERNOON TREND PARTICIPATION BY SELLING PREMIUM BENEATH THE MOVE.
⚠️ v2.0 — **THE ORB LINK IS SEVERED.** Operator, 2026-08-14, after TC.6 went
silent for an entire afternoon: *"Trend participation should have nothing to do
with orb range after the 11AM cutoff... If they are linked in any way after
11AM, then it's wrong."*
WHY THE ORB ANCHOR WAS WRONG, and it was wrong from the start:
  · **IT WAS THE WRONG LEVEL.** v1.x anchored on the broken ORB boundary, which
    was imported from a measurement of MORNING runaway trades where price was
    still near the opening range. By 13:00 that range is four hours stale and
    price may be nowhere near it.
  · **IT MADE AN AFTERNOON STRATEGY DEPEND ON MORNING STATE.** `orb_state.json`
    is WRITE-ONLY — there is no load path anywhere in the repo — so the ORB
    engine lives entirely in memory. The 2026-08-14 10:37 restart wiped
    `invalidation_reason` on all 15 boxes, and because ORB cannot re-arm past
    its 11:00 cutoff, **the runaway flag was gone permanently for the session.**
    TC.6's hard gate became unsatisfiable no matter what the tape did. A whole
    afternoon of zero fires, from a silent gate.
  · **AND THE GATE WAS SILENT**, which is how the afternoon was spent guessing.
THE ANCHOR IS NOW THE SESSION EXTREME — the operator's own original framing,
*"a vertical spread at the floor of the Move."* Session LOW for a bull trend,
session HIGH for a bear. It updates continuously, exists on every box every day,
survives restarts, and needs nothing from the morning.
MEASURED (`spread_counterfactual --anchor floor`, 18 sessions, PDL + session
low): TRENDING_BEAR +0.39 / +0.48 / +0.46 and TRENDING_BULL +0.60 / +0.66 /
+0.78 at 0.00%% / 0.25%% / 0.50%% beyond the floor.
⚠️ **BOTH ARMS POSITIVE, so this is a GENERAL credit edge rather than a
FAILED. Stated plainly rather than dressed up.
⚠️ AND THE RUNAWAY GATE WAS A CATEGORY ERROR. Operator: *"The reason it
requires a runaway before 11am is because ORB OWNS THAT SLOT. So a runaway is
the only exception a different trade can execute."* The runaway is a
SLOT-ARBITRATION rule, never an anchoring rule — ORB owns 09:35-11:00, and a
runaway is the one condition where ORB is definitively out (INVALIDATED, never
re-arms) so the slot frees. The correct occupants of that freed slot ALREADY
EXIST and are unchanged by this file: `trend_continuation_handoff` (via
`_is_runaway`) and `SweepReversal` (gates on `invalidation_reason in ("runaway",
"timeout")`).
**AFTER 11:00 ORB HAS STOPPED ENTIRELY — there is no slot to arbitrate**, so
requiring the arbitration condition was asking permission from a strategy that
is not running. TC.6 owns afternoon trend participation outright.
DIRECTION COMES FROM THE TREND VOTE (`overall_direction` + ADX), the same source
CNT.1's breakout branch already uses — no new machinery, and no dependence on
any morning artefact.
EXIT: BREACH OR NICKEL. Breach is a CLOSED BAR through the floor recorded AT
ENTRY. Fixed, not ratcheting: a floor that follows price would tighten the
invalidation on a winning trade, which is the opposite of letting it run — and
the short strike it was sold against does not move either.
⚠️ **THE MEASURED EV WAS HELD TO EXPIRY, UNMANAGED.** No premium stop, no
ratchet. `is_trend_credit` keeps `exit_engine` out of the condor ladder.
STRIKE SELECTION HAS ONE OWNER, AND IT IS NEITHER STRATEGY.
`strategy/credit_vertical.py` implements rail -> min-distance -> not-exceeded ->
quote-width -> POP, and both this file and the condor import it. TC.6 used to
instantiate `IronCondorStrategy` to borrow five of its methods and six of its
`CONDOR_*` knobs — so a condor tuning change silently retuned this trade, and
its identity had to survive as a flag on a record built by the condor's own
execution path. That is the coupling that produced 108 bad trades on
2026-08-14.
