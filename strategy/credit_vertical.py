strategy/credit_vertical.py  v4.0
Credit vertical construction, liquidity and POP helpers.

v4.0  2026-08-19  Ported from options_trader_v3 at the OTV4 split.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
Dated release framing and trivia are stripped; what remains is the
reasoning behind the thresholds, the design guarantees, and the
defects that recur when forgotten. WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires
this block be read before the file is edited.

strategy/credit_vertical.py — options_trader_v3 — (TCS.1)
SWALLOW T1: this file's silent handler(s) now announce
        themselves once. Behaviour unchanged in every case; only the silence
        was the defect.
SELECTION MATH SHARED BY EVERY CREDIT VERTICAL. OWNED BY NEITHER STRATEGY.
⚠️ WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS, and it is not tidiness.
`TrendCreditSpread` was built inside `IronCondorStrategy`'s plumbing: it borrowed
six `CONDOR_*` constants, five of its methods, set `is_iron_condor = True`, and
executed and exited through `_execute_condor_leg` / `_evaluate_condor_leg`. Two
consequences, one of them already paid for:
  · **CHANGING A CONDOR KNOB SILENTLY RETUNED A DIFFERENT TRADE.** `CONDOR_MIN_POP`
    governed both. Nothing said so.
  · **AND ON 2026-08-14 IT PRODUCED 108 BAD TRADES.** Because TC.6 rode the
    condor's execution path, its identity had to survive as a FLAG on the record
    (`is_trend_credit`) — and when `_execute_condor_leg` hardcoded condor
    identity instead, the flag never arrived, the exit branch never fired, and
    every leg inherited the condor's ratchet and 25% premium stop. **A trade
    living inside another trade's plumbing fails the moment one hop drops a
    field.**
So the math both trades genuinely share lives HERE, imported by both, owned by
neither. Each strategy keeps its OWN constants, so a knob change reaches exactly
the trade it names.
⚠️ **VALUES ARE UNCHANGED BY THIS MOVE.** Every function is lifted verbatim from
`IronCondorStrategy`; the TCS_* defaults equal the CONDOR_* values they replace.
This is a de-coupling, not a re-tune — behaviour must be provably identical, and
a test asserts the defaults still match.

# ── SWALLOW T1 REVIEW, 2026-08-17 ────────────────────────────────────────────
# The three handlers below were flagged as silent. **All three FAIL CLOSED and
# their behaviour is correct**: an unreadable quote ranks worst (9.99), fails
# `quote_ok`, or scores POP 0.0 — every path ends in "do not select this
# contract". None of them can grant permission.
# They are noisy-once now because a SYSTEMATIC quote problem would otherwise be
# indistinguishable from a genuinely illiquid chain: every contract silently
# ranked 9.99 looks exactly like a chain with no liquidity, and the strategy
# would simply stop trading with nothing to read.
