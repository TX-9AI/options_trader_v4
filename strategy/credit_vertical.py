strategy/credit_vertical.py  v4.4
v4.4  2026-09-03  r234 — `search_wing` RETURNS A NAMEDTUPLE AND IS
      BRACKETED FROM BOTH ENDS. r219 added a fifth value and MISSED two guard
      returns still returning four; both callers unpacked five, so a short leg
      with no bid raised ValueError into `_safe_strategy` and read as a clean
      DECLINE. `WingResult` makes that unrepresentable. And the search now has
      a NARROW-side bound — `stop_survivable` — because R rises as the wing
      narrows while the stop narrows with it, so a selector that only
      maximises R optimises INTO the least survivable structure (r208 C.43,
      found in the butterfly and never carried here). `why_key` names which
      rung refused, as a FIELD rather than prose a caller would sniff.
v4.3  2026-09-02  r219 — 🔴 THE ENTRY AND THE MARK WERE ON DIFFERENT SIDES OF THE QUOTE.
      `search_wing` priced the credit as short.BID - long.ASK and that number
      became `sig.entry_premium` — the position's entry of record — while
      `position_manager._fetch_current_premium` marks a credit vertical at
      short.MARK - long.MARK. The gap is BOTH HALF-SPREADS, present the
      instant the position opens, and for a credit vertical a higher mark is a
      LOSS. Measured on the fleet's shape: judged $0.37, booked $0.97, gap
      $0.60 — against a lone stop carrying 60.5 cents of room. The position
      was born at its stop.
      🔑 SWEEP FORENSICS 2026-08-25..09-02 SAYS THE UNDERLYING NEVER DID IT:
      38 of 41 stopped, price NEVER reached the short strike on any of 22
      measurable trades, and moved 0.63 points toward it — implying a spread
      delta of 0.96, which a 5-wide cannot carry.
      ⚠️ OPERATOR RULING 2026-09-02: "I have a ladder for live offers, all
      paper needs to fill at mark, period." The MARK is booked. The BID/ASK
      credit is kept for the R hurdle — deciding on the conservative number
      and booking the mark refuses trades that only clear R when priced
      optimistically, so the error runs in the safe direction.
      ⚠️ AND THE OLD BEHAVIOUR HAD A PASSING TEST: check_plan_prepares S2
      asserted net_credit == 1.30, the bid/ask figure, so the suite certified
      the mismatch. Re-derived to 1.33.
v4.2  2026-08-28  r175: pop_drift() — POP with the session's measured drift,
      signed toward safety, horizon-bounded (operator: "You have to get it
      firing in ESPECIALLY this type of day … A trend day we should be
      killing it & on chop we stay out"). TCS only; pop() unchanged for the
      mean-reversion trades, whose premise is not a drift.
Credit vertical construction, liquidity and POP helpers.

v4.1  2026-08-27  r157 (RECORDED RETROACTIVELY in r159 — r157 added
      `search_wing()` here with no title bump and no entry). `search_wing`
      prices every listed strike beyond the short on BID/ASK and returns the
      highest-R wing; the caller compares it to `r_floor` — R is a
      construction target, not a filter. Shared by all four credit strategies.
v4.0  2026-08-19  Ported from options_trader_v3 at the OTV4 split.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
Dated release framing and trivia are stripped; what remains is the
reasoning behind the thresholds, the design guarantees, and the
defects that recur when forgotten. WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires
this block be read before the file is edited.

strategy/credit_vertical.py — options_trader_v3 — (TCS.1)
SWALLOW T1: this file's silent handler(s) now announce
        themselves once. Behaviour unchanged in every case; only the silence
        was the defect.
SELECTION MATH SHARED BY EVERY CREDIT VERTICAL. OWNED BY NEITHER STRATEGY.
⚠️ WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS, and it is not tidiness.
`TrendCreditSpread` was built inside `IronCondorStrategy`'s plumbing: it borrowed
six `CONDOR_*` constants, five of its methods, set `is_iron_condor = True`, and
executed and exited through `_execute_condor_leg` / `_evaluate_condor_leg`. Two
consequences, one of them already paid for:
  · **CHANGING A CONDOR KNOB SILENTLY RETUNED A DIFFERENT TRADE.** `CONDOR_MIN_POP`
    governed both. Nothing said so.
  · **AND ON 2026-08-14 IT PRODUCED 108 BAD TRADES.** Because TC.6 rode the
    condor's execution path, its identity had to survive as a FLAG on the record
    (`is_trend_credit`) — and when `_execute_condor_leg` hardcoded condor
    identity instead, the flag never arrived, the exit branch never fired, and
    every leg inherited the condor's ratchet and 25% premium stop. **A trade
    living inside another trade's plumbing fails the moment one hop drops a
    field.**
So the math both trades genuinely share lives HERE, imported by both, owned by
neither. Each strategy keeps its OWN constants, so a knob change reaches exactly
the trade it names.
⚠️ **VALUES ARE UNCHANGED BY THIS MOVE.** Every function is lifted verbatim from
`IronCondorStrategy`; the TCS_* defaults equal the CONDOR_* values they replace.
This is a de-coupling, not a re-tune — behaviour must be provably identical, and
a test asserts the defaults still match.

# increment on SPX and SIX on CVX — which is how a 6-wide spread collecting
# $0.58 (R 0.13) looked normal to the code and was entered SEVENTEEN times in
# twelve minutes on 2026-08-27.
# ⚠️ AND THE SPX/QQQ SPLIT MEANT EVERY OTHER SYMBOL TOOK THE QQQ DEFAULT — a
# two-way branch standing in for fifteen instruments with different prices and
# different strike ladders.
#
# THE SHORT STRIKE IS STRUCTURAL: it comes from the level, the fork tine or the
# trend boundary, and never moves. The WING is the only free variable, and the
# tradeoff is monotonic — narrower wing, less credit, less risk, HIGHER R — so
# "the wing that best clears the floor" is computable and "no wing does" is a
# definite answer rather than a guess.
#
# ⚠️ BEST R, NOT FIRST TO PASS. A wider wing sometimes pays enough extra credit
# to beat a narrower one on ratio; taking the first candidate that clears would
# leave that on the table.
# ⚠️ AND `R_FLOOR` IS READ DIRECTLY, NEVER THROUGH `r_hurdle()`, which returns
# None under relaxed. Relaxed widens EVIDENCE (sweep age, pierce depth, level
# hold rate); it does not waive economics. Routing this through the hurdle
# would restore the exact hole that produced the loop.
