strategy/structure.py  v4.0
Derives trade structure from PERSISTED fields, never a flag.

v4.0  2026-08-19  Ported from options_trader_v3 at the OTV4 split.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
Dated release framing and trivia are stripped; what remains is the
reasoning behind the thresholds, the design guarantees, and the
defects that recur when forgotten. WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires
this block be read before the file is edited.

strategy/structure.py — options_trader_v3 — (TCS.2 stage 1)
WHAT KIND OF TRADE IS THIS RECORD? DERIVED, NEVER CARRIED.
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
⚠️ THIS IS A LIVE DEFECT FIX, NOT GROUNDWORK
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
`is_trend_credit` **IS NOT A COLUMN** in the trades table. It is written into
the in-memory `TradeRecord` dict and never persisted. `get_open_trades_live()`
does `SELECT *`, so **a restart rehydrates an open trend-participation position
with the flag GONE** — and `exit_engine`'s TC.6 branch, gated on
`record.get("is_trend_credit")`, silently stops firing. The position drops into
the condor ladder and picks up the ratchet and the 25%% premium stop.
That is the SAME bug fixed on 2026-08-14 (identity hardcoded in
`_execute_condor_leg`), one level down: fixed for the process that opened the
trade, still broken for any process that inherits it. **A flag that has to be
copied at every hop will eventually be dropped at one of them** — and the hop
that drops this one is a systemctl restart, which happens on every bake.
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
THE FIX: DERIVE FROM WHAT ALREADY SURVIVES
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
`strategy` and `setup_type` are REAL COLUMNS, already written correctly by
`_execute_condor_leg` (`"TrendCreditSpread"` / `trend_credit_short`), and they
already round-trip through the database. So the discriminator needs no new
column and no migration — it needs to STOP BEING A PARALLEL BOOLEAN and start
being a reading of the fields that persist.
⚠️ WHY NOT JUST ADD THE COLUMN. A new column fixes tomorrow and not today: every
position opened before the migration still rehydrates without it, and `SELECT *`
on an older row returns None, which reads as False — the exact failure, silently.
Deriving works on rows that already exist, including the ones open right now.
⚠️ FAILS CLOSED. An unrecognised record returns DIRECTIONAL, the most restrictive
reading: it keeps its ordinary stop and never inherits a credit structure's
management. A misread must never hand a position a LOOSER exit than it earned.
