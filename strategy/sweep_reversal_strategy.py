Liquidity sweep reversal. TRIGGER REBUILT IN PHASE 2.

v4.0  2026-08-19  Ported from options_trader_v3 at the OTV4 split.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
Dated release framing and trivia are stripped; what remains is the
reasoning behind the thresholds, the design guarantees, and the
defects that recur when forgotten. WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires
this block be read before the file is edited.

strategy/sweep_reversal_strategy.py — Post-liquidity-sweep reversal for options.
SWP.4: THE RECOVERY WINDOW PENALISED GOOD REJECTIONS.
        `recovery_pct` was measured from `sweep.sweep_price` — the WICK EXTREME
        of the raid — so the DEEPER the rejection, the FARTHER the entry
        appeared, and the gate refused exactly the setups it should want.
        Reproduced on a fabricated textbook PDL raid: a 2.36% rejection produced
        recovery_pct 2.4% against the 2.0% cap and was refused with "Sweep long:
        too far from sweep", on the single best setup the scorer can produce.
        Now anchored to `sweep.pool_price` — the level that was RECLAIMED, which
        is the thesis being traded. The same setup then reads 0.11%.
        Wick depth is a measure of rejection QUALITY and `rejq_val` already
        scores it; it has no business inflating a distance-from-entry measure.
        Both sides changed. OT_SWEEP_RECOVERY_FROM_POOL=0 restores the old
        anchor exactly.
        ⚠️ VERIFIED END TO END on three fabricated scenarios: an excellent PDL
        raid now passes EVERY logic gate (L1 1.000), a weak one is still
        refused as too old (L1 0.000), and the same excellent raid into an
        ACCELERATING opposing trend scores 0.150 — a tenth of A, still above
        the long floor. The discrimination survives the unshackling.
        ⚠️ NOT CHANGED, and worth knowing: the 1m BOS lookback references recent
        swing highs, so a raid that is really a COLLAPSE (5% in two minutes)
        cannot satisfy it by construction. A realistic approach-and-raid does.
        That was a fixture defect on my side, not a code defect.
SWP.4 + SWP.5.
        SWP.4 THE RECOVERY WINDOW PENALISED GOOD REJECTIONS. `recovery_pct` was
        measured from `sweep.sweep_price` — the WICK EXTREME — so the DEEPER the
        rejection, the FARTHER the entry appeared. On a fabricated textbook PDL
        raid a 2.36% rejection produced 2.4% against the 2.0% cap and was
        refused, on the best setup the scorer can produce. Now anchored to
        `sweep.pool_price` — the level RECLAIMED, which is the thesis traded —
        where the same setup reads 0.11%. Wick depth is rejection QUALITY and
        `rejq_val` already scores it. Both sides changed.
        OT_SWEEP_RECOVERY_FROM_POOL=0 restores the old anchor.
        SWP.5 LIVENESS REPLACES THE CLOCK. `SWEEP_MAX_AGE_BARS = 8` was standing
        in for an invalidation test the code did not have. MEASURED over 90 real
        symbol-days: of the stale sweeps it refused, **32.9% still had a LIVE
        thesis** — price had never accepted back through the raided level and
        was still on the correct side. The gate now asks LIQ.3's running
        `sweep_invalidated` instead.
        RESULT on the same 90 symbol-days: refusals went from **98.4% "too old"**
        to **77.2% INVALIDATED** (the level actually failed) + 13.9% backstop,
        and setups reaching STRIKE SELECTION went **5 -> 40**.
        ⚠️ AGE SURVIVES AS A BACKSTOP, NOT AS THE TEST: SWEEP_STALE_HARD_BARS
        (48 = 4h) still refuses a live-but-ancient raid, because an
        all-session-old level is a different trade. That 48 is a PRIOR — nothing
        in the data picked it. 414 setups hit it.
        ⚠️ ALL THESE COUNTS ARE NVDA/SPX/SMCI WITH STUBBED REGIME AND VOL STATE.
        The gate ORDERING is real; the absolute numbers are not the fleet.
        OT_SWEEP_LIVENESS_GATE=0 restores the pure-clock behaviour exactly.
SWP.2: SHORT SWEEPS GET THEIR OWN FLOOR
        (`SWEEP_SETUP_FLOOR_SHORT`, default 0.20; longs stay at 0.05). Three
        measures agree that long and short are not the same trade — win rate
        81% vs 33%, never-favourable 4% vs 33%, and forward drift building to
        +0.314 vs falling to −0.290. n=6 on the short side is thin, so this is a
        PRIOR carried by the MECHANISM (the 07-27 PLTR short-into-strength
        incident), not a fit. ⚠️ With SWEEP capped near 0.265 this NEAR-DISABLES
        shorts; that is deliberate and is stated rather than disguised.
SWP.1: THE REGIME GATE IS GONE. Operator's ruling — sweep is
        an EVENT, not a market state. `generate_signal` refused unless the
        committed label was SWEEP_REVERSAL; that label wins 0.4% of live ticks,
        is exactly zero on 96%, and F7's commit threshold narrowed it further,
        so the trade was effectively off. Dispatch (main v5.6) now qualifies the
        setup on the L1 `_sweep` SCORE, whose three hard vetoes ARE the spec: a
        NAMED level, REJECTED back through, not accepted beyond.
        NEW `setup_score` kwarg carries that score and becomes the strategy's
        CONVICTION — it drives `_sweep_target_delta`, the confluence note, and
        `signal.conviction`. Previously all three read `regime.conviction`,
        which after ungating would be the AMBIENT regime's conviction (e.g.
        TRENDING_BULL at 0.80) — a nonsense input to sweep strike selection and
        a silent one. Defaults to `regime.conviction` only so an un-migrated
        caller degrades visibly rather than crashing.
        WHAT DID NOT CHANGE: the ORB-ownership gate below, the confirmed/fresh
        sweep preconditions, and the PLTR trend-opposition guard — the last of
        which lives as a soft-necessary INSIDE the score, never in the removed
        gate, so it travels with the new qualification.
ORB-OWNERSHIP GATE (hardcoded). A sweep may fire ONLY after
        the ORB has released its claim on price. While the ORB owns price —
        inside the range awaiting a break (WAITING_FOR_BREAK), broken out and
        awaiting/at retest (ARMED_LONG/SHORT), a position open (OPEN_LONG/SHORT),
        or the range failed back inside (INVALIDATED/close_inside) — the sweep
        is blocked. Released = retest went stale (INVALIDATED/timeout), price ran
        past the 50%% level (INVALIDATED/runaway), EXPIRED, or past the 11:00 ET
        cutoff. Replaces the old broke_high/broke_low check, which let a sweep
        fire the instant a break REGISTERED — i.e. while the ORB was still ARMED
        and awaiting its retest — the exact double-ownership this forbids.
        (CVX 2026-07-21 09:55: sweep short fired with price inside the range.)
        Method renamed _sweep_broke_orb -> _orb_released_price.
defect H rename only: NO_ENTRY_AFTER_ET -> ORB_NO_ENTRY_AFTER_ET.
        Same constant, same (11, 0) value, same behaviour. This file is precisely
        why the rename earns its keep: the 11:00 ORB cutoff is the ARM condition
        here (past it, the ORB window is over and sweep works any level), which
        the old name did nothing to convey.
entry-gate tuning (separate pass from detection): recovery
        window is ATR-aware (LARGER of SWEEP_MAX_RECOVERY_PCT or
        SWEEP_RECOVERY_ATR_MULT × ATR%) so fast/volatile reversals aren't
        rejected as "too far"; BOS lookback is configurable (SWEEP_BOS_LOOKBACK)
        and also accepts a BOS that closed on the just-closed candle.
ORB-BREAK GATE (registered break, not wick clear): before
        the 11:00 ET cutoff a sweep may ONLY fire after a GENUINE breakout — a
        1-min candle that CLOSED beyond the range (ORB engine broke_high /
        broke_low). A wick that pokes the boundary and closes back inside is
        still 'in range, awaiting break' → no trade (this was the AVGO hole).
        High sweep needs a registered break HIGH; low sweep needs break LOW.
        After 11:00 the ORB window is closed and the gate lifts.
ORB-boundary gate (wick clear) — superseded by v1.3.
OTM target delta scales inversely with reversal strength
        (regime conviction): strong -> far-OTM low delta, weak -> near-ATM.
repo-wide v3.0 bump: Yahoo-Finance purge & data stream
        mapping optimization (all market data now flows from the single
        shared TastyTrade candle feed — see data/candle_feed.py). No logic
        change in this file.
Ported from crypto_trader SweepReversalStrategy and adapted for 0DTE options:
- Same sweep detection (PDH/PDL, equal H/L, session H/L)
- Same 1-min BOS confirmation in reversal direction
- Strike selection: closest to 0.20 delta OTM in reversal direction
- Naked long call (low sweep → long) or naked long put (high sweep → short)
- Stop: 25% of premium paid
- TP: 100% of premium at first target; trailing stop at 50%
SWP.8 (2026-08-15) — REFUSAL PATHS PROMOTED TO INFO.
    All 10 `logger.debug` calls in this file are REASONS A TRADE DID NOT HAPPEN,
    and the fleet runs at `LOG_LEVEL="INFO"` — so **none of them existed in any
    log anyone could read.**
    ⚠️ THIS COST A WHOLE MORNING. The 2026-08-15 sweep investigation had to
    proceed by elimination-by-reading the source, because the strategy never
    said why it declined. Meanwhile the BUTTERFLY logs its gates at INFO, and
    that same morning its blocker was found in a single grep: `GEX not PINNING`
    dominating 20-50x, then the discount gate rejecting 39/26. Same class of
    question, two very different costs.
    Log-only. No gate, threshold or behaviour changes. Freeze-safe.
    ⚠️ Volume: these fire per-tick on a refused sweep, so a symbol that never
    qualifies will print steadily. That is the POINT — a silent refusal is
    indistinguishable from a strategy that was never evaluated, which is exactly
    the ambiguity that made VEL.1, the AFD.1 slot bug and this one all cost
    hours to diagnose.

          - price RAN AWAY past the 50% level with no retest
            (invalidation_reason == 'runaway'),
          - or the ORB already EXPIRED.
