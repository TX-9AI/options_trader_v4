strategy/criteria.py  v1.0  (2026-08-25)

EVERY STRICT AND RELAXED CRITERION, IN ONE FILE.

🔴 OPERATOR, 2026-08-25: *"All of our relaxed & strict criteria could live in 1
file. Not in the strategy, not in the plan. But a separate file that toggles
with the relaxed entry flag & unless already specified, it 'mutes' the r-value
rejection but everything else stays the same. On 'strict' the r-value must
clear the hurdle. Remove the relaxed reference out of the strategies and
plans."*

WHY THIS IS THE RIGHT SHAPE: before this file, answering "what does relaxed
actually change?" meant reading `relaxed.widen()` call sites scattered across
five strategy files. The answer to that question is now one screen.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
WHAT RELAXED IS FOR — and it is NOT loose entries
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🔴 OPERATOR, 2026-08-25, and this is the governing statement:
*"The relaxed sample will exercise our stops. Which in my opinion are more
important at this phase than entry price & timing. A good stop placement is
the difference between a modest loss & a catastrophic one."*

So relaxed exists to GENERATE TRADES FOR THE EXITS TO WORK ON. The entries are
knowingly mediocre; that is the point, not a side effect. Measured on
2026-08-25, the exits are earning it: `orb_structure_stop` capped five TSLA
losses between -7.3% and -18.4% of premium, against the OLD engine's
`hard_stop_41%` at -40.6% / -$645 on the same box. Roughly half the damage.
⚠️ NOT YET ESTABLISHED: that the stop CAUSED the tight band. That needs the
premium path from `quote_series` replayed through `exit_replay`; a trade that
stops at -17% might have recovered. Tight is not the same as proven.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THE ONE THING RELAXED CHANGES BY DEFAULT
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
**IT MUTES THE R-VALUE REJECTION. NOTHING ELSE, UNLESS NAMED BELOW.**

⚠️ BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THAT ADMITS. Muting R lets through trades that are
KNOWN UNPROFITABLE BY THEIR OWN ARITHMETIC. Today's CVX loop is exactly that
population: twelve put spreads at R 0.19, needing an 84% win rate to break
even, every one stopped out for about -$400. Under strict, the R gate refuses
all of them before any other machinery matters. Under relaxed they fire, ON
PURPOSE, so the stops get exercised.

⚠️ CONSEQUENCE THAT MUST NOT BE FORGOTTEN AT FIT TIME: a relaxed session
carries NO R EVIDENCE, because R was not allowed to decide anything. **The R
floor can therefore only ever be fitted from STRICT sessions.** Pooling the two
would fit a threshold on data where the threshold was disabled — the same
class of error as validating a tight threshold on a relaxed sample, which
`relaxed.py` already forbids.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
WHAT RELAXED MAY NEVER TOUCH
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🔴 **A TRIGGER OR AN INVALIDATION IS A STRUCTURAL PRICE AND IS NEVER WIDENED.**
Loosening evidence produces MORE PLANS of the same trade. Loosening a trigger
produces A DIFFERENT TRADE WEARING THE SAME NAME, and the two populations stop
being comparable — which destroys the only thing the relaxed/strict split is
for. `assert_not_structural()` below enforces it and `check_criteria.py` fails
the build if any structural constant is routed through this file.

⚠️ AND THE TAGGING STAYS WHERE IT IS. `relaxed.tag(sig)` stamps
`relaxed_entry=1` on the trade record, and `entry_engine` / `trade_logger`
read it. That is the POPULATION LABEL, not a criterion — purging it alongside
the thresholds would make relaxed and strict trades indistinguishable forever,
which is the one property this whole design depends on. Thresholds moved here;
tagging did not move.

#
#   SELECTION     — a measured preference. Loosening gives a WORSE EXAMPLE OF
#                   THE SAME TRADE, which is exactly what a debug session
#                   wants. These are the only things relaxed may touch.

#   FEASIBILITY   — physical possibility. Loosening buys nothing because the

#
# 🔴 `R_FLOOR` IS FOUNDATIONAL, AND IT IS THE INTERESTING CASE. A trade that
# cannot clear 1:1 is not a worse example of the same trade — by its own
# arithmetic it is a losing trade. Muting it is therefore NOT a normal
# relaxation, and this file says so rather than filing it as SELECTION to make
# the categories tidy. It is muted DELIBERATELY and ONLY to generate positions
# for the exits to work on (see the header). Filing it as SELECTION would have
# been the lie that let a future reader loosen it for the ordinary reason.

# 🔴 OPERATOR, 2026-08-27, after CVX re-entered the same 198/192 spread SEVEN
# times in seven minutes, each stopped within a minute, for about -$170:
# *"It's allowed to enter bad trades, but if structurally it can't even survive
# for a minute we need to address the structure."*
#
# ⚠️ THIS IS NOT THE R HURDLE AND IS NOT MUTED BY RELAXED. R asks whether a
# trade PAYS ENOUGH — an economics question, and relaxed exists to collect the
# population R would have refused. THIS asks whether the trade can EXIST: it is
# construction, like a wing that must be present before undefined risk is sold.
# A structure whose stop sits inside its own bid-ask is not a bad trade being
# collected; it is a trade that was closed before it opened, and it teaches the
# sample nothing except how fast the loop can spin.
#
# 🔴 THE MEASUREMENT THAT NAMES IT, from the CVX alerts themselves:
#   credit $0.58 · stop $0.67 (15%) -> THE STOP IS NINE CENTS AWAY.
# On a contract quoted in nickels, one quote update moves the mark further than
# the entire stop distance. The trade was not stopped out by PRICE; it was
# stopped out by its own SPREAD. That is why every attempt died inside a minute
# and why the R value alone would not have explained it.
#
# ⚠️ UNIVERSAL BY CONSTRUCTION — no per-symbol constant. The test compares two
# numbers that both come from the same option chain, so a $9 stock and a $7,000
# index are judged on the same footing. This is deliberate: `WING_WIDTH = 5.0`
# is a FIXED DOLLAR amount, which is one strike increment on SPX and SIX on
# CVX, and that asymmetry is what made a 6-wide spread collecting $0.58 look
# normal to the code.
