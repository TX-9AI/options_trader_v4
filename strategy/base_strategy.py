"""
strategy/base_strategy.py  v4.3
v4.3  2026-08-24  r99 — is_valid's credit-vertical arm accepts a ONE-SIDED
      vertical (the only shape any writer produces since r90) and FAILS CLOSED
      on a naked short, a wing without a short, or a wing inside the short.
      Was demanding all four contracts, so every sweep and fork signal died as
      `Invalid signal`. Pinned by tests/check_sweep_spread.py.
v4.2  2026-08-24  CONDOR REMODEL: add condor_trigger_source to OptionsSignal
      so every credit spread records which trigger fired it (1h_fork, 1d_fork,
      sweep_reversal, trend_orb) enabling per-source grading. Paired with the
      same column in trades (trade_logger v4.2).
v4.1  2026-08-25  r65 EXORCISM: every mention of the retired classification
      system removed - identifiers, comments, docstrings, schema. The word
      does not appear in this tree. Full accounting: REMOVAL_LOG (delivery).

Signal dataclass and the strategy interface.

v4.0  2026-08-19  Ported from options_trader_v3 at the OTV4 split.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
Dated release framing and trivia are stripped; what remains is the
reasoning behind the thresholds, the design guarantees, and the
defects that recur when forgotten. WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires
this block be read before the file is edited.

strategy/base_strategy.py — Abstract base and OptionsSignal for all strategies.
v3.0 — original release
added orb_range_high/low fields to OptionsSignal for
        strategy-aware exit routing in exit_engine.py
added 4-leg fields for IronCondorStrategy (RANGING
repo-wide v3.0 bump: Yahoo-Finance purge & data stream
        mapping optimization (all market data now flows from the single
