# Installs the S3 push service and timer.

# v4.0  2026-08-19  Ported from options_trader_v3 at the OTV4 split.

# INHERITED DOCTRINE
# MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
# Dated release framing and trivia are stripped; what remains is the
# reasoning behind the thresholds, the design guarantees, and the
# defects that recur when forgotten. WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires

# options_trader_v3/install_s3_push_timer.sh — v1.1
# the report line stops crying wolf. v1.0 read `next` out of
#        `systemctl list-timers` with an awk column offset, which printed "- -"
#        on most boxes and sent me hunting a scheduling fault twice. It now asks
#        systemd directly. NOTE an empty NEXT is still legitimate and expected:
#        a timer shows no next elapse while its unit is ACTIVE, i.e. while a
#        drain is in flight. That is health, not failure — so it is labelled.
# initial release. Installs the box-side warehouse pusher
#        (warehouse/s3_push.py) as s3-push.service + s3-push.timer, sourced
#        from deploy/ in the repo rather than written inline, so the units are
#        version-controlled and reviewable instead of living in a heredoc.
#        ⚠ DOES NOT TOUCH THE BOT. daemon-reload re-reads unit definitions; it
#        does not restart running services, and the two units created here are
#        new. optionsbot and candle-feed are not stopped, restarted or altered.
#        No reboot, no pycache clear. Safe to run on a live box, though the
#        house discipline is still to install outside RTH.
#        Fast by design — well under the fleet fan-out's ~22s SSH ceiling. The
#        first push is left to the timer rather than kicked synchronously here.
# Deploy to every running box from the control server (devtools option 14):
#   cd ~/options-trader && git pull && sudo bash install_s3_push_timer.sh
