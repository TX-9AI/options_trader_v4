utils/mem_trace.py  v4.0
Memory tracing for the OOM investigations.

v4.0  2026-08-19  Ported from options_trader_v3 at the OTV4 split.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
Dated release framing and trivia are stripped; what remains is the
reasoning behind the thresholds, the design guarantees, and the
defects that recur when forgotten. WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires
this block be read before the file is edited.

utils/mem_trace.py — 
IN-PROCESS tracemalloc for the live bot, gated by `OT_MEM_TRACE`.
WHY THIS EXISTS RATHER THAN THE STANDALONE PROBE. `tests/mem_tracer.py` drives
the real chain path in a SEPARATE process, and that shape failed four times in
one afternoon for reasons that were never about memory:
  1. run on the CONTROL box, which is not a trading box
  2. run before the box had pulled the file
  3. run through `tmux ... sh -c`, which reads neither .bashrc nor the systemd
     unit environment, so it started with no credentials and the wrong symbol
     (`OT_INSTRUMENT` defaulted to QQQ on the SPX box)
  4. the `xargs -0 ... env` workaround appended the environment AFTER the
     script's own arguments, so argparse rejected them and ECHOED EVERY SECRET
     to the terminal
Every one of those is the same root cause: a second process cannot easily
inherit the trading environment. **The bot already HAS it.** Running the trace
inside the bot removes the entire class.
WHAT IT MEASURES. The SPX leak: ~5.7 MB/min, SPX-only, 91% of RSS anonymous
private-dirty (so it IS the Python heap, which is what makes tracemalloc the
right tool). QQQ carries a comparable chain and was FLAT over a 16-minute
sample, so this is not chain size alone.
COST WHEN DISABLED: one module-level bool test per tick. `tracemalloc` is never
imported unless the flag is on, so the default path pays nothing.
COST WHEN ENABLED: tracemalloc itself adds roughly 10-30% memory overhead and
some per-allocation time. **On a 951 MB box that overhead is itself a risk** —
which is exactly why SPX was resized to 2 GiB first. Do NOT enable this
fleet-wide on the 1 GiB boxes.
USAGE (SPX box, in the systemd unit or an ExecStart env):
    OT_MEM_TRACE=1            enable, defaults below
    OT_MEM_TRACE_EVERY=40     snapshot cadence in ticks (~10 min at 15s)
    OT_MEM_TRACE_WARM=20      ticks before the reference snapshot is taken
    OT_MEM_TRACE_TOP=12       sites reported per dump
