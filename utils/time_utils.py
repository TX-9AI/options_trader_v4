utils/time_utils.py  v4.2
v4.2  2026-08-24  r101: entries_open() — the 09:35 order gate (config
      ENTRY_OPEN_ET), fail-closed. Openings only; no exit path reads it.

v4.1  2026-08-21  r60: is_past_entry_cutoff + NO_ENTRY deleted with the
      unauthorized global cutoff.
Timezone, RTH session helpers, market-clock utilities.

v4.0  2026-08-19  Ported from options_trader_v3 at the OTV4 split.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
Dated release framing and trivia are stripped; what remains is the
reasoning behind the thresholds, the design guarantees, and the
defects that recur when forgotten. WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires
this block be read before the file is edited.

utils/time_utils.py — Timezone, RTH session helpers, and time utilities.
All bot logic operates in US/Eastern time to match market hours.
NO_ENTRY is READ FROM CONFIG (defect H). It was hardcoded
        as dtime(14, 0), so editing config could not move the global cutoff.
        It now derives from config.ORB_NO_ENTRY_AFTER_ET.
        NOT a behaviour change: ORB_NO_ENTRY_AFTER_ET is (14, 0), the same value
        that was hardcoded. Note the config constant this does NOT read is
        ORB_NO_ENTRY_AFTER_ET (11:00) — that is the ORB-scoped cutoff, a
        different rule. Wiring NO_ENTRY to it would silently move the global
        0DTE cutoff three hours earlier.
repo-wide v3.0 bump: Yahoo-Finance purge & data stream
        mapping optimization (all market data now flows from the single
        shared TastyTrade candle feed — see data/candle_feed.py). No logic
        change in this file.
