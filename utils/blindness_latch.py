utils/blindness_latch.py  v4.0
Latches and alerts when the bot is flying blind.

v4.0  2026-08-19  Ported from options_trader_v3 at the OTV4 split.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
Dated release framing and trivia are stripped; what remains is the
reasoning behind the thresholds, the design guarantees, and the
defects that recur when forgotten. WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires
this block be read before the file is edited.

options_trader_v3/utils/blindness_latch.py — 
WHEN TO PAGE THE OPERATOR BECAUSE THE BOT CANNOT SEE.
The requirement (2026-08-01): if ANY condition blinds the bot — the feed going
down, stale data, a dead heartbeat, or anything else — notify immediately, and
log the exact conditions that caused it.
Two things follow from "anything else", and they shape this file:
  1. The trigger is the SYMPTOM, not a list of causes. Every return-None path in
     market_data funnels through record_blindness(); this latch reads that record
     and never re-derives a cause of its own. A cause list could only ever cover
     the failures already thought of, and the whole point is the ones we haven't.
  2. The forensic snapshot is taken at the FIRST blind tick and held. The latch
     deliberately waits a few ticks before paging, so by the time it fires the
     conditions have often moved — a feed that reconnects mid-outage would
     otherwise report healthy fields alongside an alert, which is the worst
     possible troubleshooting record. First moment wins; later ticks only extend
     the duration.
Lives apart from main.py on purpose: main.py is not importable in the test
environment (SDK, env, systemd), and an alarm nobody can unit-test is an alarm
nobody should trust. See tests/test_blindness_latch.py.
This module decides ONLY when to alert. It sends nothing and reads nothing —
callers pass the blindness record in and act on the returned verdict.
