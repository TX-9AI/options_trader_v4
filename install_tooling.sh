# install_tooling.sh  v4.1
v4.1  2026-08-25  r65 EXORCISM: every mention of the retired classification
      system removed - identifiers, comments, docstrings, schema. The word
      does not appear in this tree. Full accounting: REMOVAL_LOG (delivery).

# Installs shared tooling onto a box.
#
# v4.0  2026-08-19  Ported from options_trader_v3 at the OTV4 split.
#
# INHERITED DOCTRINE
# MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
# Dated release framing and trivia are stripped; what remains is the
# reasoning behind the thresholds, the design guarantees, and the
# defects that recur when forgotten. WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires
# this block be read before the file is edited.

#!/bin/bash
# install_tooling.sh — make a CHECKOUT's tooling runnable, with no controller.
# VERIFY THE REPO IMPORTS. v1.1 checked only that pyflakes
#        and pytest were present and then printed "tooling ready" — while the
#        venv could not import the repo at all, because `requests` was never
#        declared in requirements.txt despite data/macro_data.py importing it.
#        Result: pytest was installed, the suite failed at COLLECTION, and the
#        symptom looked like a pytest problem for weeks. Now it imports data,
#        analysis and risk and REFUSES to report ready if any of them fail.
# +pytest. It was never in requirements.txt nor verified
#        here, so `python -m pytest tests/` on control failed repeatedly with
#        "No module named pytest" — a provisioning gap, not a command mistake.
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   Every bot in this fleet runs independently — there is no requirement for a
#   controller to exist at all. So the repo has to be able to provision its own
#   tooling wherever it is cloned, not only where setup_ec2.sh happened to run.
#   setup_ec2.sh STEP 7 already installs requirements.txt into a venv, so a FULL
#   install has always been covered. What was never covered is a BARE CHECKOUT —
#   a clone used as a source of tools rather than as a running bot. The control
#   server's ~/options-trader-v3 is exactly that, and on 2026-07-30 push.sh v1.8
#   gained a hard dependency on pyflakes for its undefined-name gate. Nothing had
#   ever installed this repo's dependencies there, so the gate could not run and
#   push.sh correctly refused every push.
#   That is not a bug in the gate — refusing is the designed behaviour, because a
#   guard that silently skips is the exact failure class it was written to catch
#   (continuation `mid` 07-29, butterfly `_mult` 07-30). It is a gap in
#   provisioning, and this closes it.
# WHAT IT DOES
#   Installs requirements.txt with whatever python is active — the repo venv if
#   one exists, otherwise the system interpreter. Then VERIFIES the tools the
#   repo's own scripts depend on actually import. Idempotent; safe to re-run.
# USAGE
#   bash install_tooling.sh            # from anywhere; resolves its own repo
