data/options_chain.py  v4.2
v4.2  2026-08-29  r177: OptionsChain.atm_iv — the field main's butterfly
      dispatch had been reading NEVER EXISTED (getattr default masked it);
      EM starved fleet-wide and GEXPinButterfly could never fire. Median of
      the 3 nearest-to-spot streamed ivs per side, decimal; 0.0 when the
      feed has no ivs, so the no-fallback starvation stays loud.
v4.1  2026-08-25  r65 EXORCISM: every mention of the retired classification
      system removed - identifiers, comments, docstrings, schema. The word
      does not appear in this tree. Full accounting: REMOVAL_LOG (delivery).

Chain construction, strike selection, chain_subs publication.

v4.0  2026-08-19  Ported from options_trader_v3 at the OTV4 split.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
Dated release framing and trivia are stripped; what remains is the
reasoning behind the thresholds, the design guarantees, and the
defects that recur when forgotten. WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires
this block be read before the file is edited.

data/options_chain.py — Options chain data from TastyTrade SDK.
TERM.1: publish a NARROW ATM BAND for the weekly and
        monthly expiries so TERM STRUCTURE becomes computable. Every snapshot
        to date carried a SINGLE expiry equal to the session date - skew and IV
        level available, term slope impossible - and chain history cannot be
        retrieved afterwards, so each day collected single-expiry has no term
        structure permanently.
        ~9 STRIKES PER TENOR, NOT A CHAIN. Term structure needs ATM IV out at a
        date, not walls/GEX/a delta ladder. Full chains x3 would be ~750
        subs/box against the ~40 concurrent-session cap v3.1 measured - the
        constraint that removed the per-box streamer entirely - and SPX has
        already been OOM-KILLED at 419 MB on chain volume. ATM bands are ~270.
        PLACED AFTER THE CHAIN IS BUILT because spot is not known earlier;
        `chain.spot_price` is derived from the ATM strike further up, and an
        earlier call would have banded around 0.0 and published the lowest
        strikes on the board.
        WRITES ONLY TO `chain_subs_aux`. `chain_subs` is CHECK (id = 1) and
        belongs to the bot's own expiry; candle_feed v3.15 unions the aux rows
        and FAILS OPEN if this never runs or writes garbage.
STORE READER (Option 1b — supersedes v3.1's own streamer).
        Live fleet test of v3.1 measured TastyTrade's unpublished session cap
        near ~40 concurrent: 29 candle-feeds + 29 per-box chain streamers do
        NOT fit (only ~6-11 chain streamers were admitted; the rest sat in
        backoff all afternoon). This release removes DXLink from the bot
        process ENTIRELY: candle_feed v3.4 carries the Greeks/Quote
        subscriptions on its existing socket and publishes latest values to a
        chain_marks table in the shared store; this module (a) publishes the
        desired streamer-symbol set + expiry to chain_subs, and (b) reads
        chain_marks like every other store consumer. Fleet steady state:
        29 sessions total — the number proven safe for weeks. Kept from v3.1:
        structure cache (OT_CHAIN_STRUCT_REFRESH_S), staleness ceiling
        (OT_CHAIN_STALE_S — stale marks are refused, never served), and the
        zero-mark FAIL-LOUD (bootstrap-aware: quiet for the first ticks after
        publishing subs while the feed populates). REQUIRES candle_feed v3.4
        on the box — fails loud with a version hint if the tables are absent.
PERSISTENT CHAIN STREAMER (superseded same day; header kept
        for the record). Fail-loud + structure cache introduced here survive.
        The old code opened a NEW DXLinkStreamer websocket on EVERY fetch_chain()
        call — one full REST-token + connect + auth + subscribe + teardown cycle
        per 15 s tick per box. Across the fleet that saturated TastyTrade's
        (unpublished) concurrent-session pool: DXLink returned
        'user sessions has exceeded the configured limit' roughly once per tick
        on 24/29 boxes, quotes/Greeks came back empty, every contract kept
        mark=0.0, the mark>0.05 liquidity filters rejected every strike in every
        plausible-looking "no setup" day. Changes:
        1. ONE long-lived DXLinkStreamer per process (lazy connect on the shared
           tasty_client loop thread, held via AsyncExitStack). Subscriptions are
           RECONCILED (only never-seen symbols subscribed; expiry rollover
           unsubscribes all and resets). Steady state: 2 sessions/box
           (candle-feed + this), ZERO churn.
        2. Reconnect with EXPONENTIAL BACKOFF (5s → 60s cap) on stream failure —
           a saturated pool is never hammered at tick cadence again (the old
           retry-every-15s kept the pool full and made the outage self-sustaining).
        3. Latest-value Greeks/Quote maps persist across ticks (each tick drains
           pending events non-blocking; only never-seen symbols block briefly).
           If the stream is DOWN and the last event is older than
           OT_CHAIN_STALE_S, fetch_chain returns None — stale marks are never
           served as fresh (an open position priced off dead marks would trip
           the -25% floor on garbage).
        4. FAIL-LOUD: a built chain in which NO contract has mark>0 returns None
           with an ERROR log instead of a structurally-valid corpse. Silent
           zero-mark chains are what hid this outage for five hours.
        5. Chain STRUCTURE (REST strike list) is cached OT_CHAIN_STRUCT_REFRESH_S
           (default 30 min) — the 0DTE strike set is static intraday; only
           Greeks/marks need per-tick freshness, and those ride the stream.
        Env knobs: OT_CHAIN_STRUCT_REFRESH_S=1800 · OT_CHAIN_INIT_COLLECT_S=10 ·
        OT_CHAIN_RECONNECT_BASE_S=5 · OT_CHAIN_RECONNECT_MAX_S=60 ·
        OT_CHAIN_STALE_S=120.
delta-band sweep selection (caller passes a strength-scaled
        target delta); ORB nearest-strike snap breaks toward higher/lower delta.
repo-wide v3.0 bump: Yahoo-Finance purge & data stream
        mapping optimization (all market data now flows from the single
        shared TastyTrade candle feed — see data/candle_feed.py). No logic
        change in this file.
Chain fetching:  get_option_chain(session, symbol) → dict[date, list[Option]]
Greeks/marks:    read from the store's chain_marks table (candle_feed v3.4 owns
                 the one DXLink socket and publishes latest values)
Workflow:
  1. get_option_chain() returns all Option objects (no pricing)
  2. Filter to today's expiry (0DTE)
  3. Publish desired symbols to chain_subs; read Greeks/Quotes from chain_marks
  4. Build OptionsChain with fully populated OptionContract objects
