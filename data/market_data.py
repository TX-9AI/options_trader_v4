data/market_data.py  v4.0
Frame accessors over the candle store, with staleness refusal.

v4.0  2026-08-19  Ported from options_trader_v3 at the OTV4 split.

INHERITED DOCTRINE
MEASUREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS CARRIED FROM v3 - NOT A CHANGELOG.
Dated release framing and trivia are stripped; what remains is the
reasoning behind the thresholds, the design guarantees, and the
defects that recur when forgotten. WORKING_AGREEMENT 32 requires
this block be read before the file is edited.

options_trader_v3/data/market_data.py — Underlying price data (candles + live
quote). v3.3
Candle history:    shared TastyTrade/DXFeed store (written by candle_feed.py —
                   the ONLY DXFeed subscription on the box)
Live quote:        shared store primary (latest 1m close), TastyTrade SDK
                   market-data endpoint secondary
YAHOO-FINANCE PURGE / data stream mapping optimization.
        The legacy Yahoo-Finance client removed entirely (it was a DIFFERENT series than the DXLink/DXFeed tape
        the bot trades and logs on — provably divergent on the 5-minute
        opening range). This module now READS the on-box shared SQLite store
        maintained by data/candle_feed.py (one producer, many readers). No
        network, no DXFeed, no Yahoo anywhere in this module. Public contract of
        fetch_candles / fetch_quote / fetch_all_candles preserved EXACTLY so
        data_cache.py, all four engines, main.py, get_orb_range.py, query.py,
        and the off-repo shadow observer (via get_cache()) need zero changes.
        The legacy Yahoo period map was deleted.
        Failure semantics — fail loud, never silently short:
          * Store missing/empty, or feed heartbeat older than OT_FEED_STALE_S
            (default 120s) => return None + WARNING. A crashed candle-feed
            surfaces as "no data", never as stale numbers driving decisions.
          * A young session with only 6 one-minute bars is REAL data, not
            failure — return the bars we have. A 25-bar window legitimately
            cannot fill until ~25 minutes in; that is arithmetic, not a bug.
          * Intraday windows (1m/5m/15m) are NOT padded across the overnight
            gap with the prior session's bars: they are scoped to the most
            recent session present in the store. (Escape hatch:
            OT_FEED_INTRADAY_SCOPE=continuous restores multi-session windows.)
            1h/1d naturally span sessions.
REGRESSION FIX: session-scoping now applies to 1m ONLY.
        Scoping 5m/15m as well broke the prior-session carry in
        get_orb_range.py (no priors visible ⇒ "no valid opening range found in
        lookback window" every tick, orb_range.json never refreshed — GLD and
        GOOGL, 2026-07-13) and silently forced trend_engine's 5m vote to NEUTRAL
        until ~14:05 ET (EMA_SLOW+5 = 55 bars unreachable in a session-scoped
        window). The no-overnight-padding rule belongs to the 25-bar 1-minute
        RANGING slope window and nothing else. 5m/15m/1h/1d are continuous.
POISON-CANDLE GUARD (consumer side). DXFeed intermittently
        emits a junk candle at the signed-32-bit rollover (ts=2147483648xxx ms =>
        2038) with all prices 0.0 (observed live: GOOGL 1m then 15m, 2026-07-13).
        It sorted to the top of the ts DESC window, computed a NEGATIVE age (thus
        passing the freshness check) and returned close=0.0 — which run_analysis
        reads as falsy => "Could not fetch current price" => the tick loop died
        EVERY TICK while systemd still reported the unit ACTIVE. Silent and total.
        fetch_quote() and fetch_candles() now exclude non-positive prices and
        future-dated bars at the SQL layer, and fetch_quote re-asserts a
        non-negative age before returning. Feed-side fix: data/candle_feed.py v3.2.
BAR-RECENCY GUARD + BLINDNESS RECORD. The heartbeat proves
        the PRODUCER is alive; it does NOT prove the BARS are current. A feed
        writing 15-minute-stale bars has a perfectly fresh `__feed__/heartbeat`
        row, so `_feed_alive()` passes and every engine reading 5m/15m/1h frames
        consumes delayed data with NO signal anywhere. Only fetch_quote was
        protected (QUOTE_MAX_AGE_S re-asserts bar age on the price path);
        fetch_candles had no recency check at all. Not a sandbox-only concern —
        any fault that keeps the writer running while data lags (a DXLink
        subscription silently ceasing on one interval, a partial fault after a
        reconnect) produces the same silent staleness.
        Now: every fetch_candles return computes the newest bar's age against
        that timeframe's own bar width and flags it past STALE_BAR_MULTIPLE
        (default 3.0 widths) during RTH.
        WARN-ONLY BY DEFAULT — a stale frame is still returned, because refusing
        one would halt trading on a false positive. Set OT_BLIND_REFUSE=True to
        return None instead; that is a trading-behaviour change and ships OFF.
        Every blind condition (store missing, heartbeat stale, no bars, all-NaN,
        empty session scope, stale bars) now also records a FORENSIC SNAPSHOT via
        record_blindness() — cause code plus the measured fields — retrievable
        with last_blindness(). The tick loop latches on it and alerts; the
        snapshot is captured at the moment of failure, not at alert time, because
        by the time a latch trips the conditions have often already changed.
